# METTLE Core FAQ

This is the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) for METTLE Core. Asking a question somewhere (i.e. [**Twitter**](https://discord.gg/Rmv3PBN),
 [**Discord**](https://twitter.com/PlanarianGames), or
 [**Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/PlanarianGames/)) practically ensures it will end up here as well.

### Why did you use such a weird dice pool?
- It makes it possible to Check one Attribute against a foe's Attribute as the difficulty, directly.
Standard dice pools have to resort to having both sides roll, derived attributes, halving the foe's Attribute, or other tricks
in order to have a chance of success, which never felt satisfying to me.

- While it may take a little getting used to, counting the Score is limited to small numbers (1s-3s)
and there is no need to calculate a margin of success - the Edge tells you that
right away. In terms of difficulty it lies between a standard White Wolf dice pool and the
special "funky dice" used by Fantasy Flight games.

### What about genres other than pulp adventure?
- I feel like pulp adventure is a good heart for the type of games I like to play.
I do plan on putting out a post-apocalyptic and a Persona/Jojo style game later.
Anyone who wants to can put out their own games in METTLE Core though, it's CC-by.
I'll even add a section on this site talking up your games when that happens.

### I want weird abilities in my game, but METTLE Core doesn't have them.
- It sure doesn't. If you want weird abilities like magic, the obvious method is
to add an Attribute(s) to cover those. For example a pool of 5 in "Magic" would
grant 5 Spells, or however you want to do it. You already know I can't stop you! You could also
just treat them like equipment but that is a matter of taste and setting.

### My dice pools are too high!
- METTLE Core is designed to keep dice pools low, usually around 5-10 dice.
Sometimes you can get very high dice pools with extreme mismatches in combat.
In this case, just use a Raise and set any excess dice to 6.
This will reduce the dice you have to throw to whatever you can tolerate.
*For example a starship (30D Attack) attacking a wombat (2D FRAME).
Of course you are not going to use 28 (30-2) dice, so Raise 20 of them to 6.
This means you will only throw 8 dice, but get to add 20 to damage.*
