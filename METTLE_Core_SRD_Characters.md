## Step 1: Name

This can be a tough choice unless you have a Dickensian knack for clever
names. A solid idea is to go with something audacious and easy to
pronounce. This will also help others at your table remember it. If you
get stuck, come back to it later. There is space at the end for pronouns
to reflect sex and/or gender.

**Examples:** *Sathington Willoughby, Kreeton, Jeremiah Harper Esquire,
Dr. Asphodel (she/her), Puddin’ Tame, etc.*

## Step 2: Appearance

This is what others see when they meet the character. These are
adventurers so make them stand out! Look to this section later when you
need to introduce them to others in-game. Appearances are freeform but
try to include their apparent age, gender, and a distinctive feature to
remember them by. When playing someone with different features than
yourself, do so with care and respect.

**Examples:** *a clean-cut androgynous youth with a long red nose; a
filthy man in a trench coat with a shuffling gait; a woman of a certain
age showing only a crooked smile under the outsized brim of a floral
hat.*

Invent, choose, or Roll on the table below to snap you out of any pesky
creative paralysis. The distinctive features shown below are common
options but by no means the only ones. Be creative and make these
choices sing on your character sheet!

|     6,6    |     Voice (gruff, flat, high-pitched…)                |

## Step 3: Attributes

These are your character’s ***<span class="smallcaps">Focus</span>,
<span class="smallcaps">Frame, Motive</span>, <span
class="smallcaps">Nature</span>,*** and ***<span
class="smallcaps">Poise</span>*** pools. Attributes lend them substance
within the rules of the game. Their ***Pool*** means how many dice they
grant. The more dice in their pool, the better they are at related
actions.

Each Attribute also has a ***Descriptor***, a word or phrase fleshing
out what the Attribute covers. This is vital for the ***<span
class="smallcaps">Focus</span>*** Attribute and a role-playing aid for
the others. Players may leave Descriptors blank at creation and discover
them as they play.

Starting characters are well above average, with room to grow. You can
make more or less “heroic” characters by changing the number of points
they start out with. Choose a starting ***array*** or buy Attributes
***freestyle***. Both methods are equivalent.

**Array method:** this gives a starting array of \[**5, 4, 3, 3, 2\].**
Put each of the array numbers into each of your Attribute pools in any
order you please.

**Freestyle method:** take **22** points to spend between your pools.
The highest pool costs double, and you cannot put more than half your
points in any one Attribute. When finished, all pools must be at least 1
and at most 6 for normal humans.

{: .lh-0}
|     Pool    |     Rating     |     Highest    |     Other    |
|:-----------:|:---------------|:--------------:|:------------:|
|      1D     |     Poor       |        2       |       1      |
|      2D     |     Low        |        4       |       2      |
|      3D     |     Average    |        6       |       3      |
|      4D     |     High       |        8       |       4      |
|      5D     |     Great      |        10      |       5      |
|      6D     |     Amazing    |        12      |       6      |

Attribute pools can improve later with experience points (***XP,***. You get these by recounting highlights from the last adventure.

Unusual settings may include extra Attributes for things like
cybernetics, magic, superpowers, and martial arts.

###  <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span>

This is the Adventurer’s calling in life, and the size of their dice
pool tells you how good they are at it. <span
class="smallcaps">Focus</span> is special because it can replace other
Attributes if higher and better suited for the task. For example, a
*Royal Fencing Instructor* could use their <span
class="smallcaps">Focus</span> instead of <span
class="smallcaps">Poise</span> when wielding a light sword, or in place
of their <span class="smallcaps">Nature</span> when scolding their
dilettante students. Being able to rely on more than one Attribute to do
something also helps when one of them is Strained
 or otherwise lowered by circumstance.

Assume that characters are generally competent and may use half of their
<span class="smallcaps">Focus</span> pool even for tasks unrelated to
their Descriptor. For example, a very skilled Carpenter *could* pilot a
plane, if poorly. Some tasks are impossible regardless of <span
class="smallcaps">Focus</span>, of course.

A character has only one <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span> but may
take several Backgrounds  for variety.
These serve as lesser versions of a <span
class="smallcaps">Focus</span>. If <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span>
is lowered, that becomes the new max for Backgrounds.

**<u>Example Descriptors</u>:** *cat burglar, astromech pilot, village
blacksmith, unemployed librarian, time-traveling lunatic, courtier,
etc.*

### <span class="smallcaps">Motive</span>

An interesting character has a goal to drive their actions and keep them
going even when things seem hopeless. <span
class="smallcaps">Motive</span> forms part of the Mettle score and
serves as passive Difficulty to counter the wiles of stealthy or
manipulative foes. A strong motive may be unhealthy for a normal person,
but adventurers tend towards overwhelming drives and fixations. The
Descriptor may change during play, especially if fulfilled.

**<u>Example Descriptors</u>:** *Avenge my master, bring justice to the
oppressed, consume great quantities, escape from the oubliette, kill
vampires, etc.*

### <span class="smallcaps">Nature</span>

Sheer force of personality. A high pool can drastically alter the effect
of a Descriptor! For example, the mysterious stranger and the cranky
teenager may both be *Sullen*, but only one of them makes it look good.
Social Checks default to this pool, as do Rallies and Rattles in combat.
Characters are more complex than this, so view the Descriptor for <span
class="smallcaps">Nature</span> as only the tip of their personal
iceberg.

**<u>Example Descriptors:</u>** *Sullen, earnest, mellow, intense,
friendly, feisty, high self-esteem, manipulative, affable, strange,
pensive, etc.*

### <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span>

The way an adventurer moves is often the first thing one notices about
them. For an enemy, it may be the last! Check this for coordinated
Actions like fighting, dancing, climbing, swimming, and sneaking. It
also acts as a measure of general bodily health. The Descriptor should
show how they present themselves to the world.

**<u>Example Descriptors:</u>** *Smooth & graceful, lightning reflexes,
clumsy, walks with a limp, stiff-legged gait, fast-paced, takes it
slow.*

### <span class="smallcaps">Frame</span>

Adventurers come in all shapes and sizes. The pool reflects how
physically powerful the character is within those constraints: their
might, ferocity, and vitality. <span class="smallcaps">Frame</span>
helps bear burdens as well as dish out and take damage in combat. The
Descriptor should show their body type or build and can include their
species if non-human.

**<u>Example Descriptors:</u>** *medium, tall and lanky, short, chunky,
average build, athletic, pot-bellied, lanky, plump, stout, sprightly,
etc.*

Thinking up good Descriptors for Attributes can be difficult. Use the
table below if you need inspiration or want to let chance decide. Reword
to fit your idea of the character, if needed. The <span
class="smallcaps">Focus</span> Descriptor is vital, the rest are aides
to role-playing.

## Step 4: Backgrounds

These short phrases broaden the character by giving them a history and
extra skills to go with it. You get dice to distribute into Background
pools equal to the sum of your <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span>,
<span class="smallcaps">Motive</span>, and <span
class="smallcaps">Nature</span>. Buy these on a one-for-one basis, with
a maximum in any one Background equal to <span
class="smallcaps">Focus</span>. For example, a <span
class="smallcaps">Focus</span> 5, <span class="smallcaps">Motive</span>
3, and <span class="smallcaps">Nature</span> 3 grants 11 dice to spend.
One may switch <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span> and a Background
later if they are equal, reflecting a change in priorities.

The maximum in any Background is equal to Focus. If Strain lowers <span
class="smallcaps">Focus</span>, Background pools count as no higher than
that until restored.

One Background must describe their native language and culture.
Language-granting Backgrounds should include the name of a place, with
the language in parentheses. For example, “Baltimorean (English)” or
“Sicilian (Italian).” Check language-granting Backgrounds for cultural
knowledge or local flavor.

You may hold off on choosing some Backgrounds until you know your
setting better. A good rule of thumb is to spend about half of the
Background dice at creation. Some players like to wait until they need
one, and then spend their points to have had it all along.

**Example:** *Poor farm boy from Ohio, Cheated his way into an
Ivy-league school, Led a jailbreak from Alcatraz, Jiu-Jitsu
practitioner, Trying to learn Mandarin, extensive collection of lewd
figurines, etc.*

<center><strong>BACKGROUND SEEDS</strong></center>

Invent your own or use the table below for inspiration. Two or three
good Backgrounds are plenty, keeping in mind how many dice you have
available for each. More so than other tables in character creation, it
is vital to flesh these out and make them your own. Try to intertwine
Backgrounds with Contacts and <span class="smallcaps">Motive</span>!

One Background must be your native land and language. You won’t find
those on the chart below - talk with your Guide instead.

## Step 5: Resources

Outfitting your character with gear, possessions, and contacts is a
terrific way to get to know them. Intangibles like debts, favors, oaths,
promises, burdens of guilt, memberships, rank, personality flaws, or
deals belong here as well. What they have available will influence how
they deal with situations that arise.

You need only specify important gear that enables or enhances their
abilities. When a character would reasonably have something else, be
reasonable and assume they do. Even if they did not write it down, a
scientist knows people at their lab, someone with a car has a spare tire
in the trunk, etc.

### Credit

The money, funding, access, or abstract “pull” a character
has. The Guide assigns Credit based on the setting and Character
circumstances. This is usually a 2 or 3 for most games. Credit can
change wildly during play as the wheel of fortune turns.

<center><strong>CREDIT</strong></center>

{: .lh-0}
|     Credit    |     Afford      |     Ranking        |
|:-------------:|-----------------|--------------------|
|        1      |     $9          |     Needy          |
|        2      |     $99         |     Struggling     |
|        3      |     $999        |     Comfortable    |
|        4      |     $9,999      |     Prosperous     |
|        5      |     $99,999     |     Affluent       |
|        6      |     $999,999    |     Rich           |

A character can afford items with up to as many digits in their price as
their Credit. For example, with Credit of 3, one can gear up with items
worth up to $999 (1-2 digits) each. If they want to buy something one
Credit digits higher, they lose a digit of Credit temporarily. Regain
this using Hustle Montage.

List discrete windfalls, suitcases full of cash, stolen piggybanks, or
other treasures as separate items. This prevents them from affecting
Credit and preserves the appeal of special loot.

### Contacts

Choose up to as many helpful people or groups as their Credit score and
write them down in the Resources box. As always, you can hold off
choosing until later. Take a Contact more than once for a stronger
relationship. As with Credit, one can also repair strained relationships
with Contacts by using a Hustle Montage.

### Encumbrance

An adventurer can only carry so much, even returning from a lucrative
outing. Each burdensome item counts as at least one *Load*, based on how
many hands it would take an average person to carry. Ignore single small
items like keys, wallets, daggers, etc. as zero Load.

One can easily carry Load equal to their <span
class="smallcaps">Frame</span>. If they carry more than this, every Zone
crossed takes up two Moves. If their Speed was higher than one Zone per
move, lower it by one instead. If they try to carry over twice their
<span class="smallcaps">Frame</span>, they are Incapacitated.

<center><strong>COMMON LOADS</strong></center>

{: .lh-0}
|     Item                                     |     Load    |
|:---------------------------------------------|:-----------:|
|     Backpack, small & filled   with gear.    |       1     |
|     Backpack,   large & filled with gear.    |       2     |
|     Footlocker or chest                      |       3     |
|     Bag of   1000 or so coins                |       1     |
|     Body, Medium (man-sized)                 |       4     |
|     Body,   Small (large dog, etc.)          |       2     |
|     Body, Large (Pony, etc.)                 |       8     |

The Load for carrying someone includes Load they have on them. This can
be important when carrying a hurt ally, packing mounts, etc. Every point
of Load penalizes Swim (Move) Checks regardless of <span
class="smallcaps">Frame</span>.

Adventurers may drop bulky items such as backpacks or sacks to avoid
encumbrance or distract pursuers. This is free but picking it back up is
a Use Action.

{: .highlight }
>-   Carry Load up to <span class="smallcaps">Frame</span> without
    trouble.
>-   If Load is over Frame, it takes two Moves to cross a Zone.

## Experience

Characters change over the course of a few games, and some of those may
be improvements in the abilities they rely on. This takes the form of
earning ***Experience points*** (XP) to raise their Attribute pools.

### Highlights

Players get XP by recounting their favorite scenes from the earlier
session. Think of this as the “On the last episode of…” recap at the
start of a TV show. The Guide should allow one to three for each
character, based on the length of the last game. A short game is good
for one, a normal one two, and a long one three Highlights. All a player
must do is mention something cool their character was involved in. Even
failures or bad ideas count if they were memorable. Other players at the
table can help if the player is struggling and asks for it.

The Guide should ask them, one at a time, something like:

**“Tell us about one of your favorite moments from the last game…”**

**Example Highlights:** *Played an Attribute well, came up with a clever
plan or idea, solved a mystery or puzzle, defeated a dangerous foe
one-on-one, good sport about a drastic failure, “went along” with a
social Check, fulfilled or advanced their <span
class="smallcaps">Motive</span>, etc.*

The Guide should be a *little* critical of these and can veto them.
Disruptive, out of character, or stupid acts are particularly
discouraged. If this comes up, consider that XP are partly diagnostic:
finding out what a player thinks is worthy tells you how they want to
play. Talk it over with the player or group if conflicts arise.

Players who miss a session can still get XP from the last one they
attended, and a bonus XP for describing how they rejoined the party.

### Spending XP

XP only raises Attributes. To raise the highest Attribute by one, spend
twice its current level in XP. To raise any “lesser” Attribute by one,
spend XP equal to the highest. If two or more of the highest Attributes
are equal, the one you are raising counts as highest.

You may spend XP during the actual game, especially during a tense
conflict! This represents learning an opponent’s moves, growing from a
rivalry, or lengthy training finally coming to fruition.

{: .highlight }
>-   Raise highest: XP = highest Attribute x 2
>-   Raise other: XP = highest Attribute

## Example Character

Dana is making a new character for an upcoming game. Her Guide said it
will be set in an alternate Baltimore circa 1904, centering on mysteries
with subtle plot-related supernatural elements. Sort of a cross between
*Gangs of New York, Bloodborne,* and *True Detective*.

<center><strong>EXAMPLE CHARACTER</strong>
<img src="images/Viktor.png" title="Character sheet for Viktor Alkaev" /></center>

**Step 1 – Name:** Viktor seems like a catchy name and a good play on
words for a character meant to be a good fighter. He needs a last name
too, but she decides to skip it for now.

**Step 2 – Appearance** Dana thinks it would be fun to play a sardonic
H.R. Mencken type with a sword-cane. She decides on a thin and
well-dressed mature gentleman. Maybe he is suffering from an old leg
injury? She writes in *“A crisply-attired gentleman with a telling limp
in his right leg.”*

**Step 3 – Attributes:** Dana decides to go with the array to keep
things simple. She chooses “*Fencing-master*” as his <span
class="smallcaps">Focus</span> at 5D. She sees him as a cantankerous and
difficult to deal with, so she puts down “*Competition*” as a <span
class="smallcaps">Motive</span> at 4D, and “*Curmudgeon*” as his <span
class="smallcaps">Nature</span> at 3D. The low 2D goes in <span
class="smallcaps">Poise</span> to reflect his “*old leg injury*” – he is
not as agile as he was before the accident. The other 3D goes in <span
class="smallcaps">Frame</span> as he “*svelte but wiry.”* She pauses for
a second; Viktor honestly seems like a bit of a jerk, but also a lot of
fun to play.

Armed with these details, she goes back to the Name step. She picks the
last name “Alkaev” from a search of Russian family names.

**Step 4 – Backgrounds**: The sum of his <span
class="smallcaps">Focus</span>, <span class="smallcaps">Motive</span>,
and <span class="smallcaps">Nature</span> gives 12 dice to spend on
Backgrounds. She gives him “Baltimorean (English) at 4D as he is
well-educated and keeps up with local events. She also gives him
“Kitchen Russian (Russian)” at 2D, which makes him conversant in the
language. It may be useful for cooking if it comes up! She has decided
he cannot find reliable work as a Fencing-master due to his leg, so he
works as a Card Dealer (4D) for a local underground gambling club. This
only spends 10 of the 12 dice, so she saves two for Background reveals
or improvements later.

**Step 5 – Resources:** Dana’s Guide assigns 2 (Struggling) for Credit
based on Viktor’s situation. Dana decides he usually wears a *brown
suit* and lives in a *modest apartment*. He carries an *elegant
sword-cane*, a *pocket-knife*, a *wrist-watch*, and a *deck of cards*.
He has two contacts for now: “Oleg” as the manager of the casino and
“Samuelson” as an old fencing rival. She can work out other Resources as
needed.
