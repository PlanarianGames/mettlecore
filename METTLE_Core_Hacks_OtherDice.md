One could add or replace the usual six-sided dice with other sizes, for example d4s, d8s, d10, d12, or even d20. Assuming that you are keeping the Score (1-3) and Edge (4+) faces the same, this will change the likely result. This is not done in METTLE Core, but other settings or derivative systems could make use of it.

>d4s are far more likely to roll Score. A designer could add or replace dice in a pool with d4s to represent a "safe" stance on a task. This would help ensure success but it would rarely be spectacular. Useful for those who are poor at a task or just cannot risk failure.

>d8 and up are more likely to roll Edge. Adding or replacing pool dice with these could represent a "risky" stance on a task. This would skew toward amazing results but also drive down the chance of actual success. Useful for all-or-none challenges that must be overcome now, or not at all. Also great for show-offs.

Twists stem from available Edge, so of course they are less likely with lower dice and more likely with higher ones.
