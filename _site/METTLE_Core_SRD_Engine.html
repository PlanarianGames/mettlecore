This is useful for random tables, enemy numbers, “ambient” damage from hazards, falls, traps, etc. To do this, roll the dice and add up the faces. The “d” in a Roll is always lower case. For example, a “3d6” roll would give a number from 3-18.</p> <p>Sometimes you will halve or double the result of a Roll. If halved, the general <strong><em>halving</em></strong> rule in this game is to round up.</p> <h3 id="modifiers"> <a href="#modifiers" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="modifiers"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Modifiers </h3> <p><strong><em>Modifiers</em></strong>, such as <strong><em>Bonuses</em></strong> (+) or <strong><em>Penalties</em></strong> (-) may apply to a Roll, such as “2d6+4” giving a result from 6 to 16, or “2d6-4” for a result from 0 to +8. A penalty can only drop a result to zero, never into the negative. To keep things moving for <em>situational</em> modifiers; bonuses do not stack with other bonuses and penalties do not stack with other penalties. Only the largest situational bonus and/or penalty counts.</p> <blockquote class="highlight"> <ol> <li>Roll the die or dice.</li> <li>Add up the die face results.</li> <li>Add bonus or subtract penalty.</li> </ol> </blockquote> <h3 id="d66"> <a href="#d66" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="d66"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> d66 </h3> <p>Some random tables in this book use a <strong><em>d66</em></strong> Roll. For these, roll one d6 and then another. For example, if you roll a 6 and a 2, you go to the row for “6, 2” on the table.</p> <h2 id="checks"> <a href="#checks" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="checks"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Checks </h2> <p>A <strong><em>Check</em></strong> is when you are “checking” to see if an action succeeds or fails by rolling a pool of dice. Unlike a Roll, a Checked action might fail outright. A Check may also yield unexpected benefits or drawbacks, making it rich in the storytelling cues it can provide.</p> <h3 id="success--failure"> <a href="#success--failure" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="success--failure"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Success &amp; Failure </h3> <p>To make a Check, declare what your character is doing, then roll dice equal to the Attribute or Background they are doing it with. Add up the face numbers of all the dice showing 1-3; this is the <strong><em>Score</em></strong>. Count the number of dice showing 4-6; this is the <strong><em>Edge</em></strong>. For example, rolling [4, 1, 3, 5, 2, 2] yields a Score of 8 (1+3+2+2) and 2 Edge (the 4 &amp; 5).</p> <p class="text-center"><strong>READING the DICE</strong></p> <center><img src="images/Dice.png" title="Six dice with faces from 1-6. Add up 1-3s, Count 4-6s" width="450" /></center> <p>Your Check succeeds if the Score <em>beats</em> the <strong><em>Difficulty</em></strong> of the task. This can be an arbitrary number set by the Guide or a target’s defensive pool. The Score only reveals success or failure; once you exceed the Difficulty you can stop counting.</p> <center><strong>DIFFICULTY</strong></center> <div class="table-wrapper"><table class="lh-0"> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: center">Difficulty</th> <th>Ranking</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">1</td> <td>Routine</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">3</td> <td>Challenging</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">6</td> <td>Daunting</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">10</td> <td>Formidable</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">15</td> <td>Nigh Impossible</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p>The more Edge you get and still succeed, the better. A higher Edge may mean they did it faster, made it harder to undo, yielded more info, improved quality, added special effects, etc. If you fail but have a lot of Edge, consider using it on a Twist .</p> <center><strong>EDGE</strong></center> <div class="table-wrapper"><table class="lh-0"> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: center">Edge</th> <th>Quality of Success</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">0</td> <td>OK</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">1</td> <td>Good</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">2</td> <td>Great</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">3</td> <td>Excellent</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">4</td> <td>Amazing</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">5+</td> <td>Legendary</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <p>Modifiers may add or subtract dice from a Check. For example, +2 means add two dice. Treat these modifiers just like a Roll where only the largest bonus and penalty counts. Modifiers can also apply to Difficulty, but only where specifically noted. For example, how shields raise <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span> for evading attacks. Players should expect a +1 to +3 bonus for having the proper tools or leverage for a task.</p> <p>The Guide should assume competence and only call for a Check when the outcome is interesting or uncertain. Players should brazenly presume success and only stop for a Check if the Guide demands it.</p> <p>One may often just assume success if their Pool is higher than the Difficulty. On the other hand, you might notice it is impossible to beat a Difficulty three times your pool or higher. Try something else!</p> <blockquote class="highlight"> <ol> <li>Roll dice equal to the relevant pool.</li> <li><em>Add</em> 1s, 2s, and 3s for the “Score” to beat Difficulty.</li> <li><em>Count</em> 4s, 5s, and 6s for the “Edge” to rate Success.</li> </ol> </blockquote> <p class="note">Some Players like to mark the 1-3 faces of the dice with a highlighter or crayon. This can speed up sorting Score &amp; Edge.</p> <p class="note">The average Score of a single die is 1, making it easy to gauge chances of success. This also means you can directly contest single Attributes, using one as the active Check and the other as its passive Difficulty.</p> <h3 id="twists"> <a href="#twists" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="twists"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Twists </h3> <p>If you fail a Check but have Edge, you may call for a <strong><em>Twist</em></strong>. This is a sort of “devil’s bargain” letting you re-roll all the Edge dice in exchange for a dramatic consequence. Tally up the new Score and Edge from the altered results. For example, a player Checks 5 dice against a Difficulty of 3. They come up [<strong>1</strong>, 4, 4, 5, 6]: Failure! They call for a Twist, keeping their Score of 1 and rolling the four Edge dice again. They get [<strong>1,3</strong>,5,5] and combine it with their old Score of 1 for [<strong>1, 1, 3</strong>, 5, 5]. The result is a Score of 5 and Edge of 2, turning it into a success!</p> <p>The default Twist is <strong><em>Strain</em></strong>, meaning you temporarily lose one die from the Attribute used. Write the new lower pool in parentheses to the right of the old one. Twists can only Strain <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span>, <span class="smallcaps">Nature</span>, and <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span> as the others are not Checked. The lowest you an Attribute can go is zero, at which point you will need bonus dice to do anything. Strained Attributes restore with a Relax Montage .</p> <p>You can make up another Twist if Strain seems too harsh and the situation inspires a different complication. These should be immediate setbacks that apply <em>regardless of success or failure</em>. For example, losing a weapon, breaking gear, straining relationships or finances, inflicting collateral damage, blurting out something incriminating, etc. That said, it can also be fun to propose a merely dramatic Twist to move the story forward. Perhaps they remember a current foe from their backstory or accidentally took the wrong suitcase!</p> <p>Anyone can help come up with a creative Twist. If the Guide <em>or</em> Player does not like it, they can always resort to Strain. This is a safety valve that settles the matter so play can continue. The Player can also call off the Twist and accept failure as the gift it is.</p> <blockquote class="highlight"> <ul> <li>On a failure, you may call for a Twist and then reroll Edge dice.</li> <li>The default Twist is a Strain, which lowers an Attribute by one.</li> <li>Other Twists are encouraged but subject to the Guide’s approval.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <center><strong>TWIST SEEDS</strong></center> <div class="table-wrapper"><table class="lh-0"> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: center"><strong>Type</strong></th> <th style="text-align: left"><strong>Example Consequences</strong></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Confuse</td> <td style="text-align: left">Lost, mistaken identity, mistranslation, half-truth, etc.</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Delay</td> <td style="text-align: left">Takes extra Round or Montage, stalled, etc.</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Dismay</td> <td style="text-align: left">Strain Contact, harm relations with others, etc.</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Falter</td> <td style="text-align: left">Lose next Action due to surprise or clumsiness, etc.</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Imperil</td> <td style="text-align: left">Friendly fire, obstacle, unwanted attention, etc.</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Reveal</td> <td style="text-align: left">Lose Cover, reveal a secret, leave clues, etc.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <h3 id="raises"> <a href="#raises" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="raises"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Raises </h3> <p>Daring players may push their luck to get more out of an action. A Raise is when you set one or more of the dice in your pool to six before the Check. Do not Check these, they go straight to Edge! This reduces your chances of succeeding but make Edge certain if you do. A player using a Raise should describe how their character is putting extra flair into the action, such as a front flip over a car or twisting the knife.</p> <p>You can still call for a Twist if this backfires!</p> <blockquote class="highlight"> <ul> <li>Set some dice aside as sixes before a Check to guarantee Edge.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <h3 id="teamwork"> <a href="#teamwork" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="teamwork"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Teamwork </h3> <p>Tasks that are harder with more people, such as moving silently in a large group, use <strong><em>Weakest-link</em></strong> Checks. The character with the highest pool Checks, but only keep a number of dice equal to the lowest pool. The dice they select become the result.</p> <p>Tasks aided by an assistant, such as digging a tunnel, use <strong><em>Strongest-link</em></strong> Checks. Both the leader and the helper Check, but they get to keep a number of dice equal to the highest. If there is more than one helper, they should work on a related task instead.</p> <p>Either way, the member with the highest pool can Raise or call for a Twist. If they choose Strain, it only applies to them. That is the sacrifice a leader makes for their team, and hopefully they will appreciate it.</p> <blockquote class="highlight"> <ul> <li>Weakest-link: Check highest, keep #dice = lowest.</li> <li>Strongest-link: leader and helper Check, keep #dice = highest.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <h2 id="mettle"> <a href="#mettle" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="mettle"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Mettle </h2> <p>The namesake of this game, Mettle stands for the will to live and how close the character is to their doom. In game terms, it is <span class="smallcaps">Motive</span> plus Armor. This is not a <em>direct</em> measure of injury. Physical damage is a “flesh wound” until it drops Mettle into the negatives. Mettle refills entirely upon starting a new Scene, and Rallies can even restore it in the heat of battle.</p> <blockquote class="highlight"> <ul> <li>Mettle = <span class="smallcaps">Motive +</span> Armor</li> </ul> </blockquote> <h3 id="taking-damage"> <a href="#taking-damage" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="taking-damage"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Taking Damage </h3> <p>Characters may suffer <strong><em>Damage</em></strong> from hazards or attacks . Each point lowers their current Mettle by one. If their Mettle drops into the negatives, that is a <strong><em>Felling blow**,</em> and they suffer the **<em>Fallen</em></strong> Status. The Fallen lose their Action and their <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span> drops to zero. They may or may not be dead, depending on a later Recover Check.</p> <p>If a hit is not a Felling blow, the Player may declare they are <strong><em>Shaken</em></strong> instead. This wound negates the damage from that hit entirely, but they lose their Free Move and discard 1s from any Checks. They can do this once more but become <strong><em>Broken</em></strong>. A Broken character loses their Free Move and discards both 1s and 2s from their Checks.</p> <p><strong><em>Death</em></strong> is possible if a Fallen character fails a later Recover Check. The Player may also just declare Death if they feel a dramatic event should be fatal. For example, falling into lava or staying behind on an exploding space station. Sometimes it’s better to go with a bang than it is to fade away. You can always make a new character.</p> <blockquote class="highlight"> <ul> <li><strong>Shaken:</strong> Lose Free Move, discard 1s on Checks.</li> <li><strong>Broken:</strong> Lose Free Move, discard 1s &amp; 2s on Checks.</li> <li><strong>Fallen:</strong> No Action and 0 <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span>.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <h3 id="mettle-surges"> <a href="#mettle-surges" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="mettle-surges"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Mettle Surges </h3> <p>Combatants can exert flurries of intense action, especially when fresh to battle. Whenever Initiative is in play, each point of Mettle they sacrifice grants them a bonus on their Attack Check . This has limits; one cannot spend more Mettle than their Motive, nor can they spend enough to lower Mettle below zero.</p> <blockquote class="highlight"> <ul> <li><strong>Surge:</strong> spend Mettle to add a bonus to your Attack.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <h3 id="status-effects"> <a href="#status-effects" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="status-effects"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Status Effects </h3> <p>Other status effects exist to vex characters aside from Shaken, Broken, and Fallen above. Most are awful but temporary. As usual, penalties from multiple sources do not stack.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Afflicted :</strong> poisoned or diseased, but still around. Take a general penalty equal to Buildup.</li> <li><strong>Blinded:</strong> Cannot see or perform tasks reliant on sight, such as reading. Other Checks less reliant on sight face a -3 penalty. Others may use Sneak against them as if they have Cover.</li> <li><strong>Deafened:</strong> cannot perform hearing-related tasks, like listening to speech or music. A Sign language or lip-reading <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span> may make up for this. Others may use Sneak against them as if they have Cover.</li> <li><strong>Encumbered :</strong> carrying Load over their <span class="smallcaps">Frame</span>. Every Zone crossed now takes up two Moves. If they try to carry twice their <span class="smallcaps">Frame</span>, they are Incapacitated instead.</li> <li><strong>Fatigued :</strong> take a penalty to all Checks due to exhaustion. This penalty is usually equal to the number of days without rest.</li> <li><strong>Incapacitated:</strong> unconscious or paralyzed. A temporary version of Fallen - lose Free Move, <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span>, and Action</li> <li><strong>Surprised:</strong> caught unawares, you do not get an Action for the first Scene when Initiative starts. Next Scene, you are no longer Surprised, and this effect ends.</li> </ul> <h2 id="example-of-play"> <a href="#example-of-play" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="example-of-play"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Example of Play </h2> <p>This gives you some insight into how to play this game, at least for the parts where you want to use the rules. Your experience may vary because any RPG depends heavily on the group involved. Play with good people and you will have a good game.</p> <p>The Guide has gotten together with a few good friends as players: <em>Dana</em> and <em>Troy</em>. Dana is playing Viktor, the embittered ex-fencer from the character creation example. Troy is playing as Kirin, a cunning and stealthy type.</p> <p><strong>Guide:</strong> Ok, so last session you two were trying to sneak into the upper floor of a suspicious antique store. It’s midday and you are still in the shop posing as customers, where we left off. There are no other customers now and the clerk is at his desk fiddling with the register. He doesn’t seem to be watching you. How are you going about this?</p> <p><strong>Troy/Kirin:</strong> Is there a door in the shop leading to the upper floor?</p> <p><strong>Guide:</strong> yes, there is – but in the back of the shop in full view of the clerk.</p> <p><strong>Troy/Kirin:</strong> hmm, I need cover to sneak in there. Any other way…?</p> <p><strong>Dana/Viktor:</strong> Well, I’m not much for sneaking around but I can distract the clerk. I look for an item and pretend I am interested. What’s in here anyway?</p> <p><strong>Guide:</strong> Oh, uh… usual antique store stuff. A set of crystal glasses, a record player, a samovar, an old cash register…</p> <p><strong>Dana:</strong> what’s a samovar?</p> <p><strong>Guide:</strong> kind of a fancy Russian tea kettle.</p> <p><strong>Dana:</strong> Oh, Viktor would know that! He has Kitchen Russian as a Background.</p> <p><strong>Guide:</strong> Good enough.</p> <p><strong>Dana:</strong> I widen my eyes and say “just like the one my mother had” loud enough to for the clerk to hear.</p> <p><strong>Guide:</strong> He perks up quickly and kind of shuffles over to you. He has some sort of limp too, but it is different than yours… unnatural.</p> <p><strong>Troy/Kirin:</strong> I start to drift over to look at the door but not in a suspicious way. Is it locked?</p> <p><strong>Guide:</strong> you can’t tell, would have to try the handle.</p> <p><strong>Dana/Viktor:</strong> don’t get carried away, he is still here. I start talking about the patina on the brass and say I need to see it in the sunlight. “If we can just go out on the porch, so I can check the color in natural light.”</p> <p><strong>Guide:</strong> Oh, good idea, but he might get suspicious or think you will run off with it, let’s do a <span class="smallcaps">Nature</span> Check.</p> <p><strong>Dana/Viktor:</strong> My <span class="smallcaps">Nature</span> is “Curmudgeon” with 3D. I start fiddling with my wallet, maybe I’ll get a bonus if he sees I have cash?</p> <p><strong>Guide:</strong> Sure, but you don’t look rich either - let’s say +1D.</p> <p>Dana throws the pool of four dice, landing on 3, 2, 2, and 6. This is a Score of 7 (3+2+2) and 1 Edge (the 6). This easily beats the Clerk’s <span class="smallcaps">Motive</span> of 4. The Edge means this should distract him for a while.</p> <p><strong>Guide:</strong> He walks out with you into the sunlight and goes into a whole story about where the samovar came from. You also notice he is squinting a lot and has awfully pointy teeth.</p> <p><strong>Dana/Viktor:</strong> Weird, I nod along.</p> <p><strong>Troy/Kirin:</strong> My time to shine. I try the door.</p> <p><strong>Guide:</strong> It’s not locked but it is very, very old and creaky. Maybe loud enough to alert the clerk.</p> <p><strong>Troy/Kirin:</strong> I lift a little to relieve the strain on the hinges and sneak in quietly, as is my way.</p> <p><strong>Guide:</strong> Bold but Check <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span> - it is very squeaky.</p> <p><strong>Troy/Kirin:</strong> Cool, at <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span> 5, this character has some moves.</p> <p>Troy throws his five dice, landing on 1, 2, 2, 5, &amp; 6. That’s a Score of 5 (1+2+2) and 2 Effect. The Guide had judged this as a 5 Difficulty task, so Kirin fails despite his natural prowess!</p> <p><strong>Troy/Kirin:</strong> But wait, I have two Edge! I want to take a Twist but don’t want Strain - anyone have a good idea?</p> <p><strong>Dana:</strong> Hmm… you lifted on the hinges, what if the door is so loose it just came off the hinges?</p> <p><strong>Guide:</strong> nice, I can work with that. The shopkeeper might notice…</p> <p><strong>Troy/Kirin:</strong> Ha… ok I’ll take it for the Twist reroll.</p> <p>Troy grabs the two Edge dice and rerolls them, leaving his original Score dice as they landed. This time he gets a 3 and a 4, making his new Score 8 (1+2+2+<strong>3</strong>) and his new Edge 1 (the 4).</p> <p><strong>Guide:</strong> you are perfectly silent, but the door is also perfectly off its hinges.</p> <p><strong>Troy/Kirin:</strong> I shake my head in disbelief, rest it against the frame, and walk upstairs.</p> <p><strong>Guide:</strong> Ok. You find yourself in a large empty room with a high ceiling. Soot covers the walls and furniture.</p> <p><strong>Troy/Kirin:</strong> Soot? Why? You said it has a high ceiling, I look up.</p> <p><strong>Guide:</strong> Ok, you look up and see… well let’s move back to Viktor outside.</p> <p><strong>Troy/Kirin:</strong> Aaaagh no! What do I see up there?</p> <p><strong>Guide:</strong> Heh. Ok Viktor, while you are talking with the clerk, he shudders, looks up to the second story window, then into the store at the door off its hinges. He kind of wiggle-walks back into the store… hissing.</p> <p><strong>Dana/Viktor:</strong> I’m going to follow him in and brain him with the kettle.</p> <p><strong>Troy/Kirin:</strong> It’s a samovar, not a kettle! Now what is on the ceiling?</p> <p><strong>Guide:</strong> you see…</p> </div> </div> <div class="search-overlay"></div> </div> </body> </html>
