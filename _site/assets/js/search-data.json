    "content": "This is the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) for METTLE Core. Asking a question somewhere (i.e. Twitter, Discord, or Facebook) practically ensures it will end up here as well. Why did you use such a weird dice pool? . | It makes it possible to Check one Attribute against a foe’s Attribute as the difficulty, directly. Standard dice pools have to resort to having both sides roll, derived attributes, halving the foe’s Attribute, or other tricks in order to have a chance of success, which never felt satisfying to me. | While it may take a little getting used to, counting the Score is limited to small numbers (1s-3s) and there is no need to calculate a margin of success - the Edge tells you that right away. In terms of difficulty it lies between a standard White Wolf dice pool and the special “funky dice” used by Fantasy Flight games. | . What about genres other than pulp adventure? . | I feel like pulp adventure is a good heart for the type of games I like to play. I do plan on putting out a post-apocalyptic and a Persona/Jojo style game later. Anyone who wants to can put out their own games in METTLE Core though, it’s CC-by. I’ll even add a section on this site talking up your games when that happens. | . I want weird abilities in my game, but METTLE Core doesn’t have them. | It sure doesn’t. If you want weird abilities like magic, the obvious method is to add an Attribute(s) to cover those. For example a pool of 5 in “Magic” would grant 5 Spells, or however you want to do it. You already know I can’t stop you! You could also just treat them like equipment but that is a matter of taste and setting. | . ",

    "title": "Step 3: Attributes",
    "content": "These are your character’s Focus, Frame, Motive, Nature, and Poise pools. Attributes lend them substance within the rules of the game. Their Pool means how many dice they grant. The more dice in their pool, the better they are at related actions. Each Attribute also has a Descriptor, a word or phrase fleshing out what the Attribute covers. This is vital for the Focus Attribute and a role-playing aid for the others. Players may leave Descriptors blank at creation and discover them as they play. Starting characters are well above average, with room to grow. You can make more or less “heroic” characters by changing the number of points they start out with. Choose a starting array or buy Attributes freestyle. Both methods are equivalent. Array method: this gives a starting array of [5, 4, 3, 3, 2]. Put each of the array numbers into each of your Attribute pools in any order you please. Freestyle method: take 22 points to spend between your pools. The highest pool costs double, and you cannot put more than half your points in any one Attribute. When finished, all pools must be at least 1 and at most 6 for normal humans. ATTRIBUTE POOLS | Pool | Rating | Highest | Other | . | 1D | Poor | 2 | 1 | . | 2D | Low | 4 | 2 | . | 3D | Average | 6 | 3 | . | 4D | High | 8 | 4 | . | 5D | Great | 10 | 5 | . | 6D | Amazing | 12 | 6 | . Attribute pools can improve later with experience points (XP,. You get these by recounting highlights from the last adventure. Unusual settings may include extra Attributes for things like cybernetics, magic, superpowers, and martial arts. Focus . This is the Adventurer’s calling in life, and the size of their dice pool tells you how good they are at it. Focus is special because it can replace other Attributes if higher and better suited for the task. For example, a Royal Fencing Instructor could use their Focus instead of Poise when wielding a light sword, or in place of their Nature when scolding their dilettante students. Being able to rely on more than one Attribute to do something also helps when one of them is Strained or otherwise lowered by circumstance. Assume that characters are generally competent and may use half of their Focus pool even for tasks unrelated to their Descriptor. For example, a very skilled Carpenter could pilot a plane, if poorly. Some tasks are impossible regardless of Focus, of course. A character has only one Focus but may take several Backgrounds for variety. These serve as lesser versions of a Focus. If Focus is lowered, that becomes the new max for Backgrounds. Example Descriptors: cat burglar, astromech pilot, village blacksmith, unemployed librarian, time-traveling lunatic, courtier, etc. Motive . An interesting character has a goal to drive their actions and keep them going even when things seem hopeless. Motive forms part of the Mettle score and serves as passive Difficulty to counter the wiles of stealthy or manipulative foes. A strong motive may be unhealthy for a normal person, but adventurers tend towards overwhelming drives and fixations. The Descriptor may change during play, especially if fulfilled. Example Descriptors: Avenge my master, bring justice to the oppressed, consume great quantities, escape from the oubliette, kill vampires, etc. Nature . Sheer force of personality. A high pool can drastically alter the effect of a Descriptor! For example, the mysterious stranger and the cranky teenager may both be Sullen, but only one of them makes it look good. Social Checks default to this pool, as do Rallies and Rattles in combat. Characters are more complex than this, so view the Descriptor for Nature as only the tip of their personal iceberg. Example Descriptors: Sullen, earnest, mellow, intense, friendly, feisty, high self-esteem, manipulative, affable, strange, pensive, etc. Poise . The way an adventurer moves is often the first thing one notices about them. For an enemy, it may be the last! Check this for coordinated Actions like fighting, dancing, climbing, swimming, and sneaking. It also acts as a measure of general bodily health. The Descriptor should show how they present themselves to the world. Example Descriptors: Smooth &amp; graceful, lightning reflexes, clumsy, walks with a limp, stiff-legged gait, fast-paced, takes it slow. Frame . Adventurers come in all shapes and sizes. The pool reflects how physically powerful the character is within those constraints: their might, ferocity, and vitality. Frame helps bear burdens as well as dish out and take damage in combat. The Descriptor should show their body type or build and can include their species if non-human. Example Descriptors: medium, tall and lanky, short, chunky, average build, athletic, pot-bellied, lanky, plump, stout, sprightly, etc. DESCRIPTOR SEEDS Thinking up good Descriptors for Attributes can be difficult. Use the table below if you need inspiration or want to let chance decide. Reword to fit your idea of the character, if needed. The Focus Descriptor is vital, the rest are aides to role-playing. | d66 | Focus | Motive | Nature | Poise | Frame | . | 1,1 | Acrobat | Achieve | Aloof | Brutish | Athletic | . | 1,2 | Artist | Afflict | Blunt | Casual | Burly | . | 1,3 | Assassin | Atone | Cheerful | Creaky | Burly | . | 1,4 | Athlete | Avenge | Cryptic | Drowsy | Chunky | . | 1,5 | Boxer | Conceal | Curious | Feral | Curvy | . | 1,6 | Burglar | Conquer | Daring | Fidgety | Gaunt | . | 2,1 | Butler | Control | Eager | Formal | Giant | . | 2,2 | Celebrity | Create | Elegant | Frantic | Healthy | . | 2,3 | Clown | Desire | Erratic | Gentle | Husky | . | 2,4 | Cowboy | Destroy | Fearful | Graceful | Imposing | . | 2,5 | Criminal | Devote | Friendly | Hasty | Lanky | . | 2,6 | Detective | Endure | Gloomy | Jerky | Leggy | . | 3,1 | Dilettante | Enforce | Intense | Jittery | Medium | . | 3,2 | Doctor | Enjoy | Kindly | Leaning | Petite | . | 3,3 | Drifter | Enrich | Loyal | Lively | Plump | . | 3,4 | Driver | Escape | Mellow | Looming | Portly | . | 3,5 | Engineer | Explore | Mirthful | Loose | Robust | . | 3,6 | Explorer | Honor | Perky | Perky | Rugged | . | 4,1 | Fencer | Imitate | Polite | Quivering | Shapely | . | 4,2 | Gambler | Impress | Proud | Regal | Short | . | 4,3 | Hacker | Learn | Quaint | Relaxed | Slender | . | 4,4 | Laborer | Obtain | Quiet | Shaky | Slight | . | 4,5 | Martial artist | Outwit | Reckless | Shifting | Squat | . | 4,6 | Mercenary | Praise | Saucy | Shuffling | Stocky | . | 5,1 | Occultist | Promise | Serious | Slinky | Stout | . | 5,2 | Pilot | Protect | Shifty | Slouching | Stubby | . | 5,3 | Royalty | Pursue | Shy | Sluggish | Stunted | . | 5,4 | Sailor | Recruit | Sincere | Smooth | Svelte | . | 5,5 | Scholar | Redeem | Sinister | Steady | Tall | . | 5,6 | Scientist | Rescue | Stoic | Stiff | Thick | . | 6,1 | Socialite | Reveal | Stubborn | Stilted | Thickset | . | 6,2 | Soldier | Revive | Suave | Swaggering | Thin | . | 6,3 | Spy | Serve | Uncouth | Tense | Trim | . | 6,4 | Student | Steal | Uplifting | Tranquil | Waifish | . | 6,5 | Vagrant | Survive | Weird | Waddling | Wide | . | 6,6 | Vigilante | Uplift | Zealous | Wiggly | Wiry | .

    "title": "Step 4: Backgrounds",
    "content": "These short phrases broaden the character by giving them a history and extra skills to go with it. You get dice to distribute into Background pools equal to the sum of your Focus, Motive, and Nature. Buy these on a one-for-one basis, with a maximum in any one Background equal to Focus. For example, a Focus 5, Motive 3, and Nature 3 grants 11 dice to spend. One may switch Focus and a Background later if they are equal, reflecting a change in priorities. The maximum in any Background is equal to Focus. If Strain lowers Focus, Background pools count as no higher than that until restored. One Background must describe their native language and culture. Language-granting Backgrounds should include the name of a place, with the language in parentheses. For example, “Baltimorean (English)” or “Sicilian (Italian).” Check language-granting Backgrounds for cultural knowledge or local flavor. You may hold off on choosing some Backgrounds until you know your setting better. A good rule of thumb is to spend about half of the Background dice at creation. Some players like to wait until they need one, and then spend their points to have had it all along. Example: Poor farm boy from Ohio, Cheated his way into an Ivy-league school, Led a jailbreak from Alcatraz, Jiu-Jitsu practitioner, Trying to learn Mandarin, extensive collection of lewd figurines, etc. BACKGROUND SEEDS Invent your own or use the table below for inspiration. Two or three good Backgrounds are plenty, keeping in mind how many dice you have available for each. More so than other tables in character creation, it is vital to flesh these out and make them your own. Try to intertwine Backgrounds with Contacts and Motive! . One Background must be your native land and language. You won’t find those on the chart below - talk with your Guide instead. | D66 | Background | . | 1,1 | Allied with a ragtag group of rebels… | . | 1,2 | Barely survived a disaster… | . | 1,3 | Betrayed by allies or superior… | . | 1,4 | Betrayed erstwhile allies or superior… | . | 1,5 | Curated a notable collection of… | . | 1,6 | Cut their sporting career short… | . | 2,1 | Ejected from the military… | . | 2,2 | Elected to public office… | . | 2,3 | Embroiled in a protest movement… | . | 2,4 | Failed to achieve their dream… | . | 2,5 | Formed a music band… | . | 2,6 | Fought as a soldier in the war… | . | 3,1 | Found oneself after years of isolation… | . | 3,2 | Inducted into a secret society… | . | 3,3 | Invented amazing gadgets… | . | 3,4 | Joined an expedition to a faraway land… | . | 3,5 | Learned a foreign language… | . | 3,6 | Lived a pampered and wealthy life… | . | 4,1 | Nearly lost it all to their vices… | . | 4,2 | Obsessed over trivia… | . | 4,3 | Ostracized for your heretical ideas… | . | 4,4 | Performed in a traveling circus… | . | 4,5 | Ran away from home… | . | 4,6 | Resigned after a great scandal… | . | 5,1 | Saved a life and changed your own… | . | 5,2 | Smuggled contraband for a living… | . | 5,3 | Spent some time in jail… | . | 5,4 | Started a business… | . | 5,5 | Stowed away on a passing ship… | . | 5,6 | Strove mightily in a great contest… | . | 6,1 | Survived on a deserted island… | . | 6,2 | Taught a valuable skill… | . | 6,3 | Took care of an ailing relative… | . | 6,4 | Lost something or someone precious… | . | 6,5 | Took something up as a hobby. | . | 6,6 | Whiled away their time with cards… | .

    "content": "Outfitting your character with gear, possessions, and contacts is a terrific way to get to know them. Intangibles like debts, favors, oaths, promises, burdens of guilt, memberships, rank, personality flaws, or deals belong here as well. What they have available will influence how they deal with situations that arise. You need only specify important gear that enables or enhances their abilities. When a character would reasonably have something else, be reasonable and assume they do. Even if they did not write it down, a scientist knows people at their lab, someone with a car has a spare tire in the trunk, etc. Credit . This is how much money, funding, access, or abstract “pull” a character has. The Guide assigns Credit based on the setting and Character circumstances. This is usually a 2 or 3 for most games. Credit can change wildly during play as the wheel of fortune turns. CREDIT | Credit | Afford | Ranking | . | 1 | $9 | Needy | . | 2 | $99 | Struggling | . | 3 | $999 | Comfortable | . | 4 | $9,999 | Prosperous | . | 5 | $99,999 | Affluent | . | 6 | $999,999 | Rich | . A character can afford items with up to as many digits in their price as their Credit. For example, with Credit of 3, one can gear up with items worth up to $999 (1-2 digits) each. If they want to buy something one Credit digits higher, they lose a digit of Credit temporarily. Regain this using Hustle Montage. List discrete windfalls, suitcases full of cash, stolen piggybanks, or other treasures as separate items. This prevents them from affecting Credit and preserves the appeal of special loot. Contacts . Choose up to as many helpful people or groups as their Credit score and write them down in the Resources box. As always, you can hold off choosing until later. Take a Contact more than once for a stronger relationship. As with Credit, one can also repair strained relationships with Contacts by using a Hustle Montage. Encumbrance . An adventurer can only carry so much, even returning from a lucrative outing. Each burdensome item counts as at least one Load, based on how many hands it would take an average person to carry. Ignore single small items like keys, wallets, daggers, etc. as zero Load. One can easily carry Load equal to their Frame. If they carry more than this, every Zone crossed takes up two Moves. If their Speed was higher than one Zone per move, lower it by one instead. If they try to carry over twice their Frame, they are Incapacitated. COMMON LOADS | Item | Load | . | Backpack, small &amp; filled with gear. | 1 | . | Backpack, large &amp; filled with gear. | 2 | . | Footlocker or chest | 3 | . | Bag of 1000 or so coins | 1 | . | Body, Medium (man-sized) | 4 | . | Body, Small (large dog, etc.) | 2 | . | Body, Large (Pony, etc.) | 8 | . The Load for carrying someone includes Load they have on them. This can be important when carrying a hurt ally, packing mounts, etc. Every point of Load penalizes Swim (Move) Checks regardless of Frame. Adventurers may drop bulky items such as backpacks or sacks to avoid encumbrance or distract pursuers. This is free but picking it back up is a Use Action. | Carry Load up to Frame without trouble. | If Load is over Frame, it takes two Moves to cross a Zone. | . ",

    "title": "Experience",
    "content": "Characters change over the course of a few games, and some of those may be improvements in the abilities they rely on. This takes the form of earning Experience points (XP) to raise their Attribute pools. Highlights . Players get XP by recounting their favorite scenes from the earlier session. Think of this as the “On the last episode of…” recap at the start of a TV show. The Guide should allow one to three for each character, based on the length of the last game. A short game is good for one, a normal one two, and a long one three Highlights. All a player must do is mention something cool their character was involved in. Even failures or bad ideas count if they were memorable. Other players at the table can help if the player is struggling and asks for it. The Guide should ask them, one at a time, something like: . “Tell us about one of your favorite moments from the last game…” . Example Highlights: Played an Attribute well, came up with a clever plan or idea, solved a mystery or puzzle, defeated a dangerous foe one-on-one, good sport about a drastic failure, “went along” with a social Check, fulfilled or advanced their Motive, etc. The Guide should be a little critical of these and can veto them. Disruptive, out of character, or stupid acts are particularly discouraged. If this comes up, consider that XP are partly diagnostic: finding out what a player thinks is worthy tells you how they want to play. Talk it over with the player or group if conflicts arise. Players who miss a session can still get XP from the last one they attended, and a bonus XP for describing how they rejoined the party. Spending XP . XP only raises Attributes. To raise the highest Attribute by one, spend twice its current level in XP. To raise any “lesser” Attribute by one, spend XP equal to the highest. If two or more of the highest Attributes are equal, the one you are raising counts as highest. You may spend XP during the actual game, especially during a tense conflict! This represents learning an opponent’s moves, growing from a rivalry, or lengthy training finally coming to fruition. | Raise highest: XP = highest Attribute x 2 | Raise other: XP = highest Attribute | .

    "content": "Dana is making a new character for an upcoming game. Her Guide said it will be set in an alternate Baltimore circa 1904, centering on mysteries with subtle plot-related supernatural elements. Sort of a cross between Gangs of New York, Bloodborne, and True Detective. EXAMPLE CHARACTER Step 1 – Name: Viktor seems like a catchy name and a good play on words for a character meant to be a good fighter. He needs a last name too, but she decides to skip it for now. Step 2 – Appearance Dana thinks it would be fun to play a sardonic H.R. Mencken type with a sword-cane. She decides on a thin and well-dressed mature gentleman. Maybe he is suffering from an old leg injury? She writes in “A crisply-attired gentleman with a telling limp in his right leg.” . Step 3 – Attributes: Dana decides to go with the array to keep things simple. She chooses “Fencing-master” as his Focus at 5D. She sees him as a cantankerous and difficult to deal with, so she puts down “Competition” as a Motive at 4D, and “Curmudgeon” as his Nature at 3D. The low 2D goes in Poise to reflect his “old leg injury” – he is not as agile as he was before the accident. The other 3D goes in Frame as he “svelte but wiry.” She pauses for a second; Viktor honestly seems like a bit of a jerk, but also a lot of fun to play. Armed with these details, she goes back to the Name step. She picks the last name “Alkaev” from a search of Russian family names. Step 4 – Backgrounds: The sum of his Focus, Motive, and Nature gives 12 dice to spend on Backgrounds. She gives him “Baltimorean (English) at 4D as he is well-educated and keeps up with local events. She also gives him “Kitchen Russian (Russian)” at 2D, which makes him conversant in the language. It may be useful for cooking if it comes up! She has decided he cannot find reliable work as a Fencing-master due to his leg, so he works as a Card Dealer (4D) for a local underground gambling club. This only spends 10 of the 12 dice, so she saves two for Background reveals or improvements later. Step 5 – Resources: Dana’s Guide assigns 2 (Struggling) for Credit based on Viktor’s situation. Dana decides he usually wears a brown suit and lives in a modest apartment. He carries an elegant sword-cane, a pocket-knife, a wrist-watch, and a deck of cards. He has two contacts for now: “Oleg” as the manager of the casino and “Samuelson” as an old fencing rival. She can work out other Resources as needed. ",

For example, a “3d6” roll would give a number from 3-18. Sometimes you will halve or double the result of a Roll. If halved, the general halving rule in this game is to round up. Modifiers . Modifiers, such as Bonuses (+) or Penalties (-) may apply to a Roll, such as “2d6+4” giving a result from 6 to 16, or “2d6-4” for a result from 0 to +8.

    "content": "A Check is when you are “checking” to see if an action succeeds or fails by rolling a pool of dice. Unlike a Roll, a Checked action might fail outright. A Check may also yield unexpected benefits or drawbacks, making it rich in the storytelling cues it can provide. Success &amp; Failure . To make a Check, declare what your character is doing, then roll dice equal to the Attribute or Background they are doing it with. Add up the face numbers of all the dice showing 1-3; this is the Score. Count the number of dice showing 4-6; this is the Edge. For example, rolling [4, 1, 3, 5, 2, 2] yields a Score of 8 (1+3+2+2) and 2 Edge (the 4 &amp; 5). READING the DICE . Your Check succeeds if the Score beats the Difficulty of the task. This can be an arbitrary number set by the Guide or a target’s defensive pool. The Score only reveals success or failure; once you exceed the Difficulty you can stop counting. DIFFICULTY | Difficulty | Ranking | . | 1 | Routine | . | 3 | Challenging | . | 6 | Daunting | . | 10 | Formidable | . | 15 | Nigh Impossible | . The more Edge you get and still succeed, the better. A higher Edge may mean they did it faster, made it harder to undo, yielded more info, improved quality, added special effects, etc. If you fail but have a lot of Edge, consider using it on a Twist . EDGE | Edge | Quality of Success | . | 0 | OK | . | 1 | Good | . | 2 | Great | . | 3 | Excellent | . | 4 | Amazing | . | 5+ | Legendary | . Modifiers may add or subtract dice from a Check. For example, +2 means add two dice. Treat these modifiers just like a Roll where only the largest bonus and penalty counts. Modifiers can also apply to Difficulty, but only where specifically noted. For example, how shields raise Poise for evading attacks. Players should expect a +1 to +3 bonus for having the proper tools or leverage for a task. The Guide should assume competence and only call for a Check when the outcome is interesting or uncertain. Players should brazenly presume success and only stop for a Check if the Guide demands it. One may often just assume success if their Pool is higher than the Difficulty. On the other hand, you might notice it is impossible to beat a Difficulty three times your pool or higher. Try something else! . | Roll dice equal to the relevant pool. | Add 1s, 2s, and 3s for the “Score” to beat Difficulty. | Count 4s, 5s, and 6s for the “Edge” to rate Success. | . Some Players like to mark the 1-3 faces of the dice with a highlighter or crayon. This can speed up sorting Score &amp; Edge. The average Score of a single die is 1, making it easy to gauge chances of success. This also means you can directly contest single Attributes, using one as the active Check and the other as its passive Difficulty. Twists . If you fail a Check but have Edge, you may call for a Twist. This is a sort of “devil’s bargain” letting you re-roll all the Edge dice in exchange for a dramatic consequence. Tally up the new Score and Edge from the altered results. For example, a player Checks 5 dice against a Difficulty of 3. They come up [1, 4, 4, 5, 6]: Failure! They call for a Twist, keeping their Score of 1 and rolling the four Edge dice again. They get [1,3,5,5] and combine it with their old Score of 1 for [1, 1, 3, 5, 5]. The result is a Score of 5 and Edge of 2, turning it into a success! . The default Twist is Strain, meaning you temporarily lose one die from the Attribute used. Write the new lower pool in parentheses to the right of the old one. Twists can only Strain Focus, Nature, and Poise as the others are not Checked. The lowest you an Attribute can go is zero, at which point you will need bonus dice to do anything. Strained Attributes restore with a Relax Montage . You can make up another Twist if Strain seems too harsh and the situation inspires a different complication. These should be immediate setbacks that apply regardless of success or failure. For example, losing a weapon, breaking gear, straining relationships or finances, inflicting collateral damage, blurting out something incriminating, etc. That said, it can also be fun to propose a merely dramatic Twist to move the story forward. Perhaps they remember a current foe from their backstory or accidentally took the wrong suitcase! . Anyone can help come up with a creative Twist. If the Guide or Player does not like it, they can always resort to Strain. This is a safety valve that settles the matter so play can continue. The Player can also call off the Twist and accept failure as the gift it is. | On a failure, you may call for a Twist and then reroll Edge dice. | The default Twist is a Strain, which lowers an Attribute by one. | Other Twists are encouraged but subject to the Guide’s approval. | . TWIST SEEDS | Type | Example Consequences | . | Confuse | Lost, mistaken identity, mistranslation, half-truth, etc. | . | Delay | Takes extra Round or Montage, stalled, etc. | . | Dismay | Strain Contact, harm relations with others, etc. | . | Falter | Lose next Action due to surprise or clumsiness, etc. | . | Imperil | Friendly fire, obstacle, unwanted attention, etc. | . | Reveal | Lose Cover, reveal a secret, leave clues, etc. | . Raises . Daring players may push their luck to get more out of an action. A Raise is when you set one or more of the dice in your pool to six before the Check. Do not Check these, they go straight to Edge! This reduces your chances of succeeding but make Edge certain if you do. A player using a Raise should describe how their character is putting extra flair into the action, such as a front flip over a car or twisting the knife. You can still call for a Twist if this backfires! . | Set some dice aside as sixes before a Check to guarantee Edge. | . Teamwork . Tasks that are harder with more people, such as moving silently in a large group, use Weakest-link Checks. The character with the highest pool Checks, but only keep a number of dice equal to the lowest pool. The dice they select become the result. Tasks aided by an assistant, such as digging a tunnel, use Strongest-link Checks. Both the leader and the helper Check, but they get to keep a number of dice equal to the highest. If there is more than one helper, they should work on a related task instead. Either way, the member with the highest pool can Raise or call for a Twist. If they choose Strain, it only applies to them. That is the sacrifice a leader makes for their team, and hopefully they will appreciate it. | Weakest-link: Check highest, keep #dice = lowest. | Strongest-link: leader and helper Check, keep #dice = highest. | .

    "title": "Mettle",
    "content": "The namesake of this game, Mettle stands for the will to live and how close the character is to their doom. In game terms, it is Motive plus Armor. This is not a direct measure of injury. Physical damage is a “flesh wound” until it drops Mettle into the negatives. Mettle refills entirely upon starting a new Scene, and Rallies can even restore it in the heat of battle. | Mettle = Motive + Armor | . Taking Damage . Characters may suffer Damage from hazards or attacks . Each point lowers their current Mettle by one. If their Mettle drops into the negatives, that is a Felling blow**, and they suffer the **Fallen Status. The Fallen lose their Action and their Poise drops to zero. They may or may not be dead, depending on a later Recover Check. If a hit is not a Felling blow, the Player may declare they are Shaken instead. This wound negates the damage from that hit entirely, but they lose their Free Move and discard 1s from any Checks. They can do this once more but become Broken. A Broken character loses their Free Move and discards both 1s and 2s from their Checks. Death is possible if a Fallen character fails a later Recover Check. The Player may also just declare Death if they feel a dramatic event should be fatal. For example, falling into lava or staying behind on an exploding space station. Sometimes it’s better to go with a bang than it is to fade away. You can always make a new character. | Shaken: Lose Free Move, discard 1s on Checks. | Broken: Lose Free Move, discard 1s &amp; 2s on Checks. | Fallen: No Action and 0 Poise. | . Mettle Surges . Combatants can exert flurries of intense action, especially when fresh to battle. Whenever Initiative is in play, each point of Mettle they sacrifice grants them a bonus on their Attack Check . This has limits; one cannot spend more Mettle than their Motive, nor can they spend enough to lower Mettle below zero. | Surge: spend Mettle to add a bonus to your Attack. | . Status Effects . Other status effects exist to vex characters aside from Shaken, Broken, and Fallen above. Most are awful but temporary. As usual, penalties from multiple sources do not stack. | Afflicted : poisoned or diseased, but still around. Take a general penalty equal to Buildup. | Blinded: Cannot see or perform tasks reliant on sight, such as reading. Other Checks less reliant on sight face a -3 penalty. Others may use Sneak against them as if they have Cover. | Deafened: cannot perform hearing-related tasks, like listening to speech or music. A Sign language or lip-reading Focus may make up for this. Others may use Sneak against them as if they have Cover. | Encumbered : carrying Load over their Frame. Every Zone crossed now takes up two Moves. If they try to carry twice their Frame, they are Incapacitated instead. | Fatigued : take a penalty to all Checks due to exhaustion. This penalty is usually equal to the number of days without rest. | Incapacitated: unconscious or paralyzed. A temporary version of Fallen - lose Free Move, Poise, and Action | Surprised: caught unawares, you do not get an Action for the first Scene when Initiative starts. Next Scene, you are no longer Surprised, and this effect ends. | . ",

    "content": "This gives you some insight into how to play this game, at least for the parts where you want to use the rules. Your experience may vary because any RPG depends heavily on the group involved. Play with good people and you will have a good game. The Guide has gotten together with a few good friends as players: Dana and Troy. Dana is playing Viktor, the embittered ex-fencer from the character creation example. Troy is playing as Kirin, a cunning and stealthy type. Guide: Ok, so last session you two were trying to sneak into the upper floor of a suspicious antique store. It’s midday and you are still in the shop posing as customers, where we left off. There are no other customers now and the clerk is at his desk fiddling with the register. He doesn’t seem to be watching you. How are you going about this? . Troy/Kirin: Is there a door in the shop leading to the upper floor? . Guide: yes, there is – but in the back of the shop in full view of the clerk. Troy/Kirin: hmm, I need cover to sneak in there. Any other way…? . Dana/Viktor: Well, I’m not much for sneaking around but I can distract the clerk. I look for an item and pretend I am interested. What’s in here anyway? . Guide: Oh, uh… usual antique store stuff. A set of crystal glasses, a record player, a samovar, an old cash register… . Dana: what’s a samovar? . Guide: kind of a fancy Russian tea kettle. Dana: Oh, Viktor would know that! He has Kitchen Russian as a Background. Guide: Good enough. Dana: I widen my eyes and say “just like the one my mother had” loud enough to for the clerk to hear. Guide: He perks up quickly and kind of shuffles over to you. He has some sort of limp too, but it is different than yours… unnatural. Troy/Kirin: I start to drift over to look at the door but not in a suspicious way. Is it locked? . Guide: you can’t tell, would have to try the handle. Dana/Viktor: don’t get carried away, he is still here. I start talking about the patina on the brass and say I need to see it in the sunlight. “If we can just go out on the porch, so I can check the color in natural light.” . Guide: Oh, good idea, but he might get suspicious or think you will run off with it, let’s do a Nature Check. Dana/Viktor: My Nature is “Curmudgeon” with 3D. I start fiddling with my wallet, maybe I’ll get a bonus if he sees I have cash? . Guide: Sure, but you don’t look rich either - let’s say +1D. Dana throws the pool of four dice, landing on 3, 2, 2, and 6. This is a Score of 7 (3+2+2) and 1 Edge (the 6). This easily beats the Clerk’s Motive of 4. The Edge means this should distract him for a while. Guide: He walks out with you into the sunlight and goes into a whole story about where the samovar came from. You also notice he is squinting a lot and has awfully pointy teeth. Dana/Viktor: Weird, I nod along. Troy/Kirin: My time to shine. I try the door. Guide: It’s not locked but it is very, very old and creaky. Maybe loud enough to alert the clerk. Troy/Kirin: I lift a little to relieve the strain on the hinges and sneak in quietly, as is my way. Guide: Bold but Check Poise - it is very squeaky. Troy/Kirin: Cool, at Poise 5, this character has some moves. Troy throws his five dice, landing on 1, 2, 2, 5, &amp; 6. That’s a Score of 5 (1+2+2) and 2 Effect. The Guide had judged this as a 5 Difficulty task, so Kirin fails despite his natural prowess! . Troy/Kirin: But wait, I have two Edge! I want to take a Twist but don’t want Strain - anyone have a good idea? . Dana: Hmm… you lifted on the hinges, what if the door is so loose it just came off the hinges? . Guide: nice, I can work with that. The shopkeeper might notice… . Troy/Kirin: Ha… ok I’ll take it for the Twist reroll. Troy grabs the two Edge dice and rerolls them, leaving his original Score dice as they landed. This time he gets a 3 and a 4, making his new Score 8 (1+2+2+3) and his new Edge 1 (the 4). Guide: you are perfectly silent, but the door is also perfectly off its hinges. Troy/Kirin: I shake my head in disbelief, rest it against the frame, and walk upstairs. Guide: Ok. You find yourself in a large empty room with a high ceiling. Soot covers the walls and furniture. Troy/Kirin: Soot? Why? You said it has a high ceiling, I look up. Guide: Ok, you look up and see… well let’s move back to Viktor outside. Troy/Kirin: Aaaagh no! What do I see up there? . Guide: Heh. Ok Viktor, while you are talking with the clerk, he shudders, looks up to the second story window, then into the store at the door off its hinges. He kind of wiggle-walks back into the store… hissing. Dana/Viktor: I’m going to follow him in and brain him with the kettle. Troy/Kirin: It’s a samovar, not a kettle! Now what is on the ceiling? . Guide: you see… . ",

    "title": "Adventures",
    "content": "Naturally, a Guide running METTLE Core wants a game both they and their players remember and enjoy. They want a story their friends feel like they are a part of. They want a world where their actions matter. For this to happen, view the game itself as creating an opportunity for a great story to arise, rather than telling one outright. A good Guide keeps their ego in Check and loosens their grip on the plot. They become fans of the Player Characters, bringing out their inner conflicts and extolling their virtues. Given the freedom of a role-playing game, your players will rarely do what you want them to. Indulge them, and as they say, roll with it. Session Zero . It is useful to hold one short session before starting to make characters and ensure everyone is on board. Reveal what the game is about, how often you play, any house rules, and how you handle missing players. Ask them to respect your veto power to limit arguments and help keep the game fun for everyone. Ask them what they want to see and do, and what they do not. Listen to them. A thorough way to cover all the bases and orient the Players is to use the Five W’s: Who, What, Where, When, and Why. | Who are the characters? International spies? An urban rescue unit? A mystery-solving knitting circle? Suggest Focus Attributes to help them make characters who fit the idea. | What is the game about? Solve a mystery or crime case? Track down a spy? Deliver a precious package? Give them the starting plot. | Where do the events occur? Baltimore? Bangladesh? A small town in Canada? This puts later events in context and makes it easy to add local flavor. | When are the events taking place? Modern-day? The 80’s? the Roaring 20’s? The dark ages? This makes it clear what resources are available and what state the world is in. | Why are they involved? Are they banding together in times of danger? Offered a prize? Embroiled in a mystery? This helps them come up with motives related to the situation. | . Many groups find Safety Tools help avoid unfun or traumatic subjects. These are rapidly evolving techniques, so search for the one currently best for your group. If there is time left, start up a short introduction scenario! . Ongoing Sessions . Here your group explores and changes the setting. Do not fret over telling a story, following a plot, or even explaining things. Let everyone, including you, find out what happens next! The party may even diverge so much from the starting scenario that it becomes an entirely different game. This is fine. If you feel like the situation lacks something, try throwing in elements of Danger, Mystery, Obstacles, Consequences, Rivals, or Victories: . | Danger: planned or random encounters with doom can raise the stakes. It becomes possible to lose something precious, often their lives. Thugs, wild animals, lawyers, assassins, bureaucrats, repo men, etc. This is a common element, because it is great, but don’t overdo it. | Mystery: adventurers face the unknown as a matter of course. A secret traitor, a shocking clue, a corpse in an empty room, levers in a secret lab, etc. Clues should reveal info and lead to a new Scene. This can even be a mystery to you - just riff on what they discover! | Obstacles: hinder the party until they overcome a challenge. A sealed door, NPCs need a favor, mountains, the demands of fame, etc. Puzzles like these help with pacing and engagement with the world. | Consequences: adventure is a moving target; the party’s world changes through their action and inaction. A villainous plan proceeds, towns rebuild, diseases spread, new powers come into being, etc. This gives the Guide the chance to let the setting breathe. | Rivals: Great minds think alike – and the party has some competition! Rivals should be a credible threat to the party’s dignity, if not their lives. A Rival also gives the Guide a fun, scene-stealing character to play who is not just another enemy to defeat. | Victories: Let the player enjoy their triumphs. You are their biggest fan after all. Their foes henchmen speak their names with dread, those they saved grant them favors, movements gain or lose momentum, etc. Resist the urge to erase their accomplishments just to drive home a feeling of gritty realism. | . Be sure to keep an eye open to see which of these your group likes best but mix it up so they don’t get bored or complacent. You also don’t need to have all these things going on, especially at once. Final Session . Through the chaos of the ongoing sessions, keep in mind how you could bring them to a close in a satisfying way. A showdown with the big bad, reconciliation with family, a great sacrifice, etc. This potential ending will probably change with every game but it does help you put the current events in perspective. Ideas . When thinking up the rough idea of a game for your players, it never hurts to scope out adventure-themed books, games, and movies. Take inspiration from these and make them your own. Subvert them. Ignore them and do something different. Some broad plot types to mine: . | Great Escape: Strand or imprison the party, who must find a means of escape. Rich ground for forming allegiances and solving puzzles. Examples: The Great Escape, Lost, Hogan’s Heroes, The Running man, Stalag 17, The Count of Monte Cristo, etc. | Treasure Hunt: Make the party aware of a lost treasure, fugitive, or other irresistible macguffin that could change their lives. Heavy on travel scenes, traps, and rival parties. Examples: every Indiana Jones, The Goonies, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, Romancing the Stone, Tales of the Gold Monkey, etc. | Countdown: The party learns of a scheme or ultimatum threatening what they hold dear. Usually followed by infiltrating the threat before directly confronting them. Examples: The Rock, Outbreak, A View to a Kill, Moonraker, Dr. Otto and the Riddle of the Gloom Beam, etc. | Rescue Mission: The party finds out an important person or creature is missing or captured and sets out to retrieve them. This always has a cost, whether negotiated with self or others. Examples: Big Trouble in Little China, The Wicker Man, Saving Private Ryan, | Special Delivery: The party must deliver an important message, item, or person. Guaranteed to be a stealth or chase scene somewhere. Examples: The Transporter, Pulp Fiction, Children of Men, From Russia with Love, Tears of the Sun, etc. | Whodunit: Embroil the party in a mystery they must solve. Will involve lots of Know Checks and player ingenuity, so make sure to drop enough clues to keep it moving. Examples: Chinatown, Live and Let Die, Clue, The Maltese Falcon, etc. | . Consider that each of these needs a “hook” - a reason for the party to get involved. For example, a rival lets it slip, it is in all the news, a superior tells them to ignore it, it results in the death of an ally, as a loose end from a prior case, etc. If they don’t take the hook, change your bait or fish elsewhere. As mentioned earlier, do not get attached to a plot. Maybe they use your setting as a sandbox, maybe as a litter box. Always remember, however, that you are a kind of player too. if it stops being fun for you, you can always stop running it for them. Faction Tracker . A web of conspiracy influences an adventure party behind the scenes. The faction tracker is an optional tool that helps the Guide keep track of three staple Factions in pulp adventures: the Villain, the Backer, and the Rival. If your setting is different, wing it or set your own web up on the Blank faction Tracker. | Backer: a person or group that aids the party. They can be relied upon as a helpful contact or for aid behind the scenes. | Rival: a person or group that competes with the party. Often another party with similar means but different methods. | Villain: a person or group that opposes the party, and vice-versa. The main driver of conflict in the game. | . FACTION SEEDS . | Roll | Enemy | Backer | Rival | . | 1 | Zealous Cult | Secret Society | Fellow Adventurer | . | 2 | Sinister Genius | Government Agency | Unpredictable Weirdo | . | 3 | Ruthless Corporation | Wealthy Philanthropist | Sly Trickster | . | 4 | Shadow Conspiracy | Curious Scholars | Bumbling Oaf | . | 5 | Greedy Criminals | Religious Order | Vengeful Ex-member | . | 6 | Aspiring Overlord | Mysterious Voice | Suspicious Investigator | . Each Faction has a box for their name, a cube for their Influence pool, and connecting arrows for their relationships. Roll 1d6 for each Influence pool then adjust if not satisfied – these values change only due to extremely impactful events. The sides of the triangle are bidirectional arrows – jot down their relation to each other, above and below. Influences comes into play when factions deal with each other. For example, the party’s Rival may try to sweet talk their Backer into lending him a helicopter originally meant for the party. The Rival Checks their Influence vs. a Difficulty of the Backers Influence. A Twist defaults to Straining their Influence or raising their target’s temporarily. FACTION RELATIONS . | Roll | Relation | Elaboration | . | 1 | Colluding | Working with them as collaborators, secret or open. | . | 2 | Extorting | Forcing them to do something or face dire consequences. | . | 3 | Undermining | Subtly deteriorating their power and reach. | . | 4 | Evading | Hiding, fleeing, defending, and evading conflict. | . | 5 | Attacking | Hostile and actively trying to destroy by whatever means. | . | 6 | Appeasing | Giving them what they want, to curry favor or halt attack. | . FACTION TRACKER . Powers . METTLE Core embraces weirdness but keeps a little distance from overt magic and super-science. These numinous mainstays of pulp fiction are often still present, but secret and special. If they appear, they tend to be plot elements: inventions of mad scientists, alien devices, or villainous sorcery. For example, a stolen idol that calls rain, a death ray, cultists summoning a loathsome entity from beyond, the holy grail, a gorilla with a human brain, etc. You can run these as narrative trump cards that simply break or glitch reality, very fancy special equipment, or as full characters in their own right. If players get ahold of them, let them have their fun. In the long run, they can always run out of charges, have disastrous side effects, be confiscated by “top men,” etc. There are other games and settings made for those who regularly traffic with such forces.

    "title": "Characters",
    "content": "An expected feature of this genre is the characters are always changing or evolving. Players may want to change their character’s Attributes, Tags, Contacts, Gear, etc. After the first game, you should even recommend this so they can make a character who works for them. In later games, ask for some justification but be lenient. No one should feel trapped by choices they made before becoming familiar with the rules, setting, or story. Sometimes a new character comes along, or old ones die or retire. A new character should start with an Attribute pool total (highest x 2 + all lesser pools) equal to the lowest in the group. Discuss how to work them in; ideally by linking them to the current situation. A surviving villain makes a great replacement character and saves time on introductions. This is also true of their henchmen or any other interesting NPCs the party hasn’t entirely alienated or deceased yet. While it is always best to have everyone at each game, things happen. Missing players can still get XP by recalling their highlights from the last session they attended. They can also get a bonus “make-up” XP for each missing session by explaining what brought them back into the story. NPC Creation . The Guide plays perhaps too many NPCs, such as friendly or unfriendly contacts, shopkeepers, enemies, key figures in the setting, and random passersby. Only key NPCs should have full Attributes. For the unnamed, a single NPC pool will do for Attributes and Mettle. Think “Stunned Bystander 3D” or “Hostile Village Elder 5D.” If they try something out of character, halve the pool as usual. If one of their Attributes is far higher, such as Frame for a large creature, list it in parentheses. Freeform Focus Descriptors . METTLE Core gives thematic examples but does limit players to a definitive list of skills to choose from. While specific settings may hint at good ones, these are supposed to be up to the Player. You decide if a given Focus is relevant to a task. Most of the time, you should say yes. If it is not obvious why and the Player doesn’t have a clever explanation, they should default to about half their dice pool. In extreme cases, do not allow the action at all. Suggest other ways the party might achieve their goal if they are stuck. Freeform XP . This method can be freeing for many groups but confusing for others. Players are meant to choose for themselves what they felt was XP-worthy about the last game and provide a useful recap while they are at it. If you feel the urge to reward a player with XP, consider doing this more directly by changing the way the scene plays out instead. Some consider this method controversial. If you are one of them and this freeform XP does not work for you, patch in a more traditional set of rewards from other games. keep them within the same range of 1-3 XP per session and there should be little trouble.

The tradeoff is the more protection a set of Armor gives, the more difficult it is to move. In other words, if Load exceeds the wearer’s Frame, it inflicts an encumbrance penalty to Poise. This can complicate actions such as swimming, climbing, travel, and sneaking. The table below gives examples of armor common to a modern setting, as well as archaic armor types for comparison. ARMOR . | Armor type | Mettle | Load | Cost | . | Archaic: |   |   |   | . |      Leather armor | +1 | 1 | 2 | . |      Chain mail | +2 | 2 | 3 | . |      Scale mail | +3 | 3 | 3 | . |      Plate mail | +4 | 4 | 4 | . | Modern: |   |   |   | . |      Kevlar vest (BP) | +1 | 0 | 3 | . |      Flak Jacket | +2 | 1 | 3 | . |      Riot gear | +3 | 2 | 4 | . Armor may be very well-crafted or Superior, subtracting 1 from Load and adding one to Cost. It may also be Inferior, adding 1 to Load and subtracting one from Cost.

    "content": "The following weapons chart gives examples of some of the more popular weapons. Each weapon has a Name to describe it, its Attack bonus, any special qualities, its Load, and Cost. Attack bonus adds to Poise on the Attack Check before subtracting your opponent’s Frame. For most muscle-powered weapons, this is Frame plus the modifier listed in the weapons table below. For firearms, this is equal to the listed value alone. A relevant Focus can replace Poise, if higher. Attack bonus stacks with situational modifiers. Specials . | 2H takes two hands to wield. | Ammo is the number of shots before reloading with a Use Action. | Block adds a bonus to Block Checks when wielded. | Burst raises the Attack bonus by that amount, hitting harder and easing Split Attacks. +1/+2/+3 uses 5/10/20 bullets respectively. | Cover adds a Cover bonus to Poise when targeted by an Attack. | Grapple use the weapon’s Attack bonus on Grapple Checks. | Entangle incapacitates instead of doing damage: Check Poise vs. the original “damage” each Round to escape. | Inferior: weapons are shoddy; lower Attack bonus and Cost by one. | Range is how far one can throw or shoot the weapon. This replaces the target’s Poise as Difficulty, if higher. If no range is given, assume the weapon can be lobbed at 4 Difficulty per Zone away. | Range S (Short) is 3 Difficulty per Zone away. | Range M (Medium) is 2 Difficulty per Zone away. | Range L (Long) is 1 Difficulty per Zone away. | . | Reach weapons do not take return damage from a Block made against them unless the blocker is also using a Reach weapon. | Scoped weapons reduce the penalty for Range (only) by that amount. | Stun weapons do their full damage when making Subdual attacks. Some can only make Subdual attacks, shown as “(only).” | Superior weapons are well-made; raise Attack bonus and Cost by one. | Wrap weapons are flexible and ignore a foe’s Cover bonuses. | .

For example, a set of proper lockpicks grants a +1 bonus to pick locks. Making do with a hairpin grants no bonus, and a fancy set could grant +2 or more.

Fair or foul, a lawyer can get them out of it. Keeping one on retainer can make escaping the consequences of your own actions faster and easier. | Local Guide: hiring a local or street urchin to show you around a new place is a great way to avoid trouble, but they can also expose you to scams.

A mounted rider may use the mount’s Speed instead of their own and enjoys Partial Cover (+2). The two must share the same Action but may split Attacks between them. Otherwise, treat them as individuals. The mount uses a simplified NPC Pool for Checks it could reasonably make, with their Frame in parentheses. The rider may use their riding-related Focus to get the Mount to do something it does not want to, such as leaping over a dangerous obstacle, learning a trick, running to exhaustion, or staying in a battlefield. Treat this as a Persuade Check (rider’s Focus vs. mount’s Pool). A trained mount behaves differently in certain conditions. For example, a war horse does not balk at combat or gunfire.

    "content": "Airplanes, mecha, or bulldozers have ratings for their ease of handling, maximum speed, and Frame. When necessary, the driver or pilot Checks their Focus vs. their current Speed. Current Speed also serves as the Difficulty for foes to target it in combat. | Handling: how easily it turns compared to others of its class. The modifier adds to the relevant Focus on Checks made to control it. | Speed: how fast it can go. This affects the Move and Race Actions in slightly different ways. Current Speed acts as a Move in Zones and as a substitute Poise score. | Frame: Size and weight. Armored vehicles just add Frame instead of using character armor rules. | . The terrain favored by a vehicle should be obvious from their type. Unsuitable terrain counts as an obstacle or impassible. Vehicle Cover . Vehicles with cabins grant Total Cover and can pop out to target others with Partial Cover. Exposed vehicles only grant Partial Cover. Vehicle Damage . Vehicles do not have Mettle. Instead, every point of damage reduces their Handling by one until repaired. An air vehicle must land if its Handling pool drops to half or lower. Crashes . A Crash is when a vehicle loses control and hits an obstacle, usually by accident. This affects speedy and delicate vehicles far more than slow and sturdy ones. A vehicle suffers a Roll of 1d6 plus Speed as damage, soaked by Frame as usual. Occupants will suffer 1d6 plus Speed damage, soaked with their own Frame(s). Occupants will take half damage if wearing seatbelts or other safety equipment. | Crash: 1d6 + Speed - Frame damage | . Ramming . This purposeful assault turns your vehicle into a deadly but fragile weapon. Check the vehicle’s current Speed, with an Attack bonus equal to its Frame, minus the target’s Frame, versus its current Speed. Ramming a pedestrian is versus their Poise. The ramming vehicle may suffer collateral damage from this risky stunt. Handle this as a Twist on a failed Ramming Check. This has the same effect as a Crash, above. In a head on collision, add the speed of both vehicles together. | Ram Vehicle: [Speed + Frame – target Frame] vs. current Speed | Ram Pedestrian: [Speed + Frame – target Frame] vs. Poise | . Speed Scaling . Vehicles with high Speeds are actually much faster than their Move in Zones. This is due to the difficulty of accelerating within the confines of a small arena. If they break out into more spacious areas the Zones also expand to accommodate their full speed. Race Checks are a good example of this.

    "content": "A Scene is an imaginary slice of time and space holding in-game events, such as arguments, discoveries, or unexpected encounters. This section describes the background parts of a Scene that help everything else work, such as time, space, and player spotlight. Time . METTLE Core uses only two types of Scenes to keep track of time: Action and Montage. | Action Scenes are for zoomed-in fast-paced dramatic Actions like fighting, sneaking, and persuasion. These usually take only seconds or minutes. | Montage Scenes are zoomed-out lengthy Montages taking hours to weeks. These include things like travel, healing, training, and shopping. Montages take a long time for the Characters, but to the Players they are mercifully brief. | . Less formal means of measuring time can include Session; the entire real-life game day, or Adventure; a series of Sessions. You can always use “realistic” measures such as seconds or days where needed. Distance . Measure distance in Zones for most Scenes. These are flexible spaces, but usually about 10 square meters and 5 meters high. A small closet can be a Zone, as can an amphitheater. Split large areas into several Zones to keep things sensible. Zones can have interesting features or Scenery , such as cover, traps, obstacles, etc. Range and movement vary depending on how many Zones an area holds! Small, cluttered areas are hard to aim around or move through. In these, the effective range of a move or weapon is not going to be as ideal as it would be on a spacious flat plain. This method works well with both “theater of the mind” and actual table maps. Defining an area in Zones helps keep things clear, encourages tactics, and eases narration of their features. If you are using a dry-erase map (and minis!) you can even trace out the Zones in color. Initiative . This decides who-goes-when in Action Scenes where order of action matters. Usually this means combat, but it can apply just as well to closely paced struggles such as social or stealth scenes. Mettle uses “Volleyball” Initiative where the acting character passes the next turn to their target, only choosing another if their target has no Action. The character who starts the conflict triggers Initiative. In case of an argument about who goes first, the Guide should give PCs the privilege. The character taking Initiative gets to take the first Action. If their target has an Action, the target gets to go next. If not, the acting character passes it to anyone else with an Action. In the latter case they may choose friend or foe, so think strategically. If they pass to a Guide NPC, they can be specific or let the Guide figure out which one. Initiative splits an Action Scene into Rounds. When everyone has taken their Action, a new Round begins. Everyone gets their Action back, and the last one to go can now pass Initiative to their target or anyone else - even to themselves again if they targeted no one! . One may Wait by selecting a specific Action, such as “Attack” and holding off until the right moment. They may take that Action any time later, even if it interrupts someone else’s. They cannot change the type of Action. If no opportunity arises, they decide at the start of the next Round to keep waiting or rejoin the regular Initiative scheme. Initiative ends when the conflict is over, by whatever means. | First to declare Action triggers Initiative. | Target goes next, if they have an Action. | Otherwise, pick anyone else with an Action. | New Round when no one has Actions left. | .

    "title": "Actions",
    "content": "Most games spend the bulk of their time in Action Scenes. These support acts of combat, persuasion, stealth, intrigue, chases, etc. While it is fun to role-play these feats, it is not important for a player be good at them personally. At a minimum they should describe what they are doing and let their character’s abilities fill in the rest. The default Twist for Actions is Strain, meaning they lose a die from the Attribute used temporarily. The Outcomes section of each Action also lists three likely alternate Twists to liven things up. These are not exhaustive, and many other possibilities exist. Be creative! . Everyone gets a free Move before their Action unless Shaken or Broken. They must use a Free Move before the regular Action and cannot use it to pass obstacles. If a character loses their Action for any reason, they do not get their Free Move either. Cohesive groups may use teamwork to combine Actions, such as the Strongest-link and Weakest-link Checks described earlier . This costs both characters their Action but takes place on the same Initiative. If the target had no Action, the character with the higher pool chooses who to pass to. ACTIONS | Action | Check | Successful Outcome | . | Attack | Poise + Attack bonus - target Frame, vs. Poise | Inflict damage on foe. | . | Block | Poise + Attack bonus - attacker Frame, vs. Poise | Deflect incoming damage. | . | Dodge | Poise vs. Attack Score | Avoid incoming damage. | . | Know | Focus vs. Difficulty | Reveal relevant info. | . | Move | Poise vs. Difficulty | Overcome an obstacle. | . | Perform | Focus vs. Difficulty | Attract positive attention. | . | Persuade | Nature vs. Motive | Sway the minds of others. | . | Race | Focus vs. Difficulty | Take the lead. | . | Rally | Nature vs. Current Mettle | Shrug off damage. | . | Rattle | Nature vs. Motive | Penalize a foe’s next Action. | . | Sneak | Poise vs. Motive | Avoid negative attention. | . | Use | Focus vs. Difficulty | Miscellaneous actions. | . Attack . Adventurers get a lot of mileage out of bone-headed violence, so learn this Action well. This applies to any physical strike, whether unarmed, melee, ranged, or even supernatural. Start with your Poise, add the weapon’s Attack bonus, subtract your target’s Frame, and then Check what remains versus their Poise. If successful, inflict one plus Edge damage as described in the Mettle section . Use a relevant military or martial arts related Focus in place of Poise, if higher. Check (Poise + Attack bonus – target Frame) vs. target’s Poise . | Success: Hit and inflict a point of damage. | Edge: Each Edge is an extra point of damage. | Failure: Target dodges or parries. | Twists: Strain, drop weapon, lose next Action, waste ammo, etc. | . There are several broad types of attacks: . | Melee Attacks are close combat strikes on a foe in the same Zone. These can be narrated as decisive strikes or flurries of blows. | Ranged Attacks strike from a Zone or more away. The Difficulty is the greater of either the target’s Poise or the Range . | Grapple Attacks restrain a foe. This is an unarmed Attack unless using a Grappling weapon. Damage becomes the target’s penalty to all Checks instead. Repeat each Round to continue the hold. | Control Attacks change the position or situation of foes. Instead of inflicting damage these disarm them, provoke them into targeting their attacker next, push or pull them a Zone, etc. If the target refuses the control, they suffer the original damage instead. | Subdual Attacks knock a foe out instead of killing. On a Felling blow, they inflict the Incapacitated status instead of damage. Regular weapons inflict half damage for this, only Stun weapons use full. | Vehicle Attacks like ramming work much like regular Attacks but use current Speed instead of Poise. See Vehicles for details. | . You can make multiple attacks by dividing the Poise pool between them as evenly as possible. For example, an attacker with 5 Poise and 3 Frame could make two Split Attacks at 6D (3+3) and 5D (2+3), or other combinations. If a foe Blocks, this interrupts the next split Attack. Modifiers are part of the Attack bonus and do not split. Block . A Block pits your own strike against your foe’s. Just like the Attack it defends against, start with your Poise, add your weapon’s Attack bonus, subtract the attacker’s Frame, and then Check what remains versus their Poise. Edge reduces damage from the incoming blow. If this would negate more than the original damage, it Counters and the original attacker suffers the excess damage! . A Block is special in regard to Initiative. It must be the very next Action after the original Attack, even interrupting a Split Attack or negating a Felling Blow. It can also interrupt Initiative to defend an ally in the same Zone, replacing them as the target. Check: (Poise + Attack bonus – target Frame) vs. attacker’s Poise . | Success: Soak a point of incoming damage. | Edge: Adds to the damage soaked. | Failure: Attacker foils your defenses. | Twists: Strain, drop weapon, lose Cover, draw more foes, etc. | . You can Block against Reach weapons like spears and tasers, but their wielder does not take any Counter damage. This advantage cancels out if both sides are wielding a Reach weapon. You can also Block ranged weapons, but this doubles the Difficulty. Dodge . A last-ditch attempt to get out of harm’s way, eating up all their effort. This works differently than most Actions as it is a Check of Poise vs. the actual Score of the incoming Attack. If successful, they avoid taking any of that damage. If there is any Edge, the dodger chooses a new target. This new target must be in the same Zone or line of fire. They take damage equal to Edge plus the incoming Attack bonus (only), soaked by Frame. If there is no Edge, they cannot misdirect the attack. Like Block, a Dodge may negate a Felling blow. Check: Poise vs. Attack Score . | Success: dodge attack entirely. | Edge: Adds to Attack bonus as damage another target. | Failure: still hit by attack. | Twists: Strain, lose next Action, lose Cover, etc. | . The Score of a successful Attack will be higher than the target’s Poise. This makes Dodge an unlikely act of desperation. However, one can Dodge a failed Attack as well! This makes it easier to trick their flailing foe into striking someone else – another enemy, a bridge support, etc. Know . In-character knowledge can uncover helpful facts. For example, a scholar translating hieroglyphs inscribed on a door, a detective inferring weight from a set of footprints, a fashionista guessing how long a corpse’s outfit has been out of style, a gambler trying to spot their opponent’s tell, etc. Know is a Check of Nature vs. fiat Difficulty, or vs. Motive if used on a person. If using an investigative or knowledge-related Focus, it is up to the Player to say why it grants info. Check: Nature vs. Difficulty (or vs. Motive if a person) . | Success: Guide answers the question to their best knowledge. | Edge: Answers more questions or finer details. | Failure: Guide tells what they should know outright. | Twists: Strain, half-truth, target alerted, one wrong clue, etc. | . The Player should frame these questions carefully if they want useful info, and Guides should be generous with answers! Always err towards giving out information, as it helps move the story along. Make a Know Check only to understand, not perceive. As such, this does not detect traps, loot, lies, or ambushes. The Guide should usually tell the players what they see without gating it behind a Check. Move . This dedicates an Action towards movement: running, climbing, jumping, swimming, etc. A character usually just takes their Move, only Checking if there is an obstacle. Avoiding traps, ducking through brambles, swimming, clambering over debris, etc. may call for a Check of Poise vs. a Difficulty set by the Guide. Exceptionally fast characters may move more than one Zone in a single Move, while slow ones may take two Moves or more to cross a single Zone. This Action is special because everyone gets a Free Move before their Action. Using the Free Move then a Move Action is “running,” and crosses two Zones. One cannot take their Free Move after an Action or to Move through an obstacle, as below. Check: Poise vs. Difficulty . | Success: Overcome obstacle or trap. | Edge: Bonus to later ally’s Move or penalty to pursuing foes. | Failure: Stopped by an obstacle or triggered trap. | Twists: Strain, drop item, cause a hazard, reveal location, etc. | . Obstacles, scaling larger foes, and traps can be worth a Move Check: . | Obstacles like walls, rivers, brambles, etc. hinder moves into the Zone. For example, you must scale or breach a wall to enter. | Scaling: larger foes count as their own Zone or more to climb upon and deal with riders, etc. Difficulty is the larger foe or mount’s Poise. | Traps like falls, pits, spikes, lava, etc. do not prevent movement but do cause injury or inconvenience on a failure. | . Chases have the quarry and pursuers Move through a set of chase Zones, with the quarry deciding where to go. How well they overcome obstacles decides who wins. Perform . Impress, sway or draw a crowd with talents like singing, comedy, oration, dancing, instruments, etc. Perform Checks a specific Focus vs. the highest Motive in a crowd. Performers may get a bonus if they know what a crowd wants to see or hear. Performances also make a great distraction so other party members can do nefarious things. Check: Focus vs. Motive (or highest Motive in the audience) . | Success: Gather an interested crowd. | Edge: New fans add bonus to future performances. | Failure: Little interest or attention. | Twists: Strain, attract trouble, waste resources, break gear, etc. | . A performance troupe or musical band should lump their efforts into a group Check. Twists and Strain affect one character who volunteers. For example, the bass player trips off the stage, the drummer falls unconscious, etc. If outright missing a part (drummer, straight-man, etc.) the Check may incur a penalty. Edge may result in gaining followers. There’s always a chance an NPC they meet later is a fan! . Persuade . Haggling, seduction, diplomacy, lies, threats, bribery, negotiation, parley, etc. All are valid alternatives or preludes to battle. This is not mind-control, and merely shifts the social situation in favor of the winner. Persuade is a Check of Nature vs. Motive. The side with more leverage may get a bonus or better narrative outcome. Check: Nature vs. Motive (or highest Motive in the audience) . | Success: The social situation sways in your favor. | Edge: Adds to Difficulty to persuade otherwise later. | Failure: The social situation plays out as it would. | Twists: Strain, Strain Contact, offend ally, reveal secret, etc. | . Success shifts the narrative for the better, but the views of those involved still depend on the actual argument. If no one uses Persuade, the Guide simply role-plays the other character or group’s reaction as they would expect it to play out. Edge makes it more difficult for others to undo the persuasion later. Note this sticky belief in the Resources section of their character sheet. It is now something they “own,” for better or worse. Players on the losing side of Persuasion can either choose to be good sports about it and go along, or outright reject the manipulation. Going along with it can easily justify an XP highlight! . Race . It takes a steady hand to keep control during a high-speed chase or aerial dogfight. The fastest racer wins, but if everyone is going the same Speed the winner is the one with the highest Edge. Racers can choose their own Speed up to their vehicle’s max, but current Speed is also the Difficulty on their Handling Check. The Guide can also spice up the course with obstacles, which add 1d6 to the Difficulty. Check: Handling vs. current Speed . | Success: Kept up pace and stayed in control. | Edge: Their lead on other racers in the same Speed group. | Failure: Crash damage to vehicle and occupants . | Twists: Strain, create obstacle, waste fuel, lose parts, etc. | . You can spend Edge on stunts instead of playing fair like a chump: . | Steady: smooth out the ride and line up the target; add Edge as bonus to any occupant’s Attacks on their target. | Swerve: juking or angling, add Edge as penalty to any foe’s Attack on the vehicle until your next Action. | Splatter: skid up mud or dirt onto the windshield. Inflicts Edge as penalty to target’s Handling Checks until cleaned. Must be going the same speed as the target and have something to splatter. | . Ramming or sideswiping is an Attack. Current speed is king – a slower vehicle cannot normally ram a faster one. Altitude can matter too; a ground vehicle cannot ram an airborne vehicle, except in wild situations. The Guide must call on their best judgment as usual. Rally . Restores Mettle by shaking off the pain of flesh wounds. This is a Check of Nature vs. the current Mettle of the character. One can only Rally if chosen to receive Initiative by another. They are too distracted to Rally if they took Initiative because a friend or foe targeted them. This makes teamwork among Players especially important for Rallies. Check: Nature vs. current Mettle . | Success: Clear a point of damage. | Edge: Clear that many extra points of damage. | Failure: Do not clear any damage. | Twists: Strain, reveal secret, offend ally, draw more foes, etc. | . If the gracious ally who passed Initiative to them has a higher Nature, the Rallying character may Check on that instead of their own. Play it up as words of encouragement. Rattle . Taunting, threatening, trash-talking, and demoralizing an enemy. This Action is only effective if the target can understand the onslaught of indignity hurled at them. This is a Check of Nature vs. Motive, but a spiteful, authoritative, or comedic Focus can do just as well. The target cannot stop thinking about the insult if successful. This makes them very error prone, inflicting a penalty to their next Action. Check: Nature vs. Motive . | Success: Foe’s next Action faces -1 penalty. | Edge: each Edge worsens penalty by one. | Failure: Foe shrugs off the ineffectual intimidation. | Twists: Strain, reveal secret, offend ally, draw more foes, etc. | . Penalties from multiple rattlers do not stack. A target only feels the most hurtful heckling that round. Sneak . Moving silently and hiding in shadows are great ways to evade foes and get into places you aren’t supposed to be. This only allows you to remain unnoticed by others. It is not possible if someone is looking right at you, or you do not have anywhere to hide. This is a Check of Poise vs. Motive, or the highest Motive in a group. A Stealthy Focus can swap in for Poise, if higher. Check: Poise vs. Motive . | Success: Remain unnoticed by your foes. | Edge: Adds to Attack bonus during Surprise, or steal/plant that many small items. | Failure: They notice you. | Twists: Strain, leave telltale clues, end up in different area, drop gear, etc. | . Hiding is a matter of finding Cover rather than a checked Action. If their seekers move into a position where the Cover would fail, the hider can try a Sneak Check to slip away. The better the hiding spot, the better the bonus to avoid discovery. Surprise attacks can trigger after a successful Sneak. The surprised side goes a Round without an Action. Next Round things go back to normal for the survivors. Use . This covers miscellaneous moves using a device, tool or item. For example, pulling a sticky lever, starting an unfamiliar vehicle, picking a lock, etc. This is usually unchecked. If it calls for one, use a relevant Focus vs. a fiat Difficulty. Let a failure stand - move the story along instead of allowing retries. Check: Focus vs. Difficulty . | Success: Uses the item properly. | Edge: Quicker, better, with flair, etc. | Failure: The task is harder than it looks. | Twists: takes another Round to finish, break tools, attract unwanted attention. | .

    "content": "A Montage Scene is a transition between intense Action Scenes. While they may mark the passage of a long period of time in the setting, they should pass quickly at the table. The Guide typically allows each player a Montage then moves along to the next Scene. This helps with pacing and avoids sessions spent agonizing over minute details. If your party is engaged in Montages of different durations, it is fair for those with shorter tasks to get another Montage. Distractions, emergencies, and procrastination prevent further industry. MONTAGES | Montage | Check | Successful Outcome | . | Craft | Focus vs. Difficulty | Finish project. | . | Hustle | Focus vs. Difficulty | Regain Credit or Contact. | . | Recover | Focus vs. Difficulty | Stabilize or heal wounds. | . | Relax | None | Restore Strained Attributes. | . | Study | Focus vs. Difficulty | Search for clues or answers. | . | Travel | Focus vs. Difficulty | Arrive safely. | . Craft . If players want to try their hand at lengthy undertakings such as art, smithing, repair, writing, lockpicking, etc., they must gather the right materials and make a Check on a relevant Focus. Only call for Checks if there is time pressure or real doubt about being able to finish. Check: Focus vs. Difficulty . | Success: a finished project. | Edge: also finished that many other, less Difficult projects. | Failure: unfinished project. | Twists: Strain, waste materials, Strain Resources, weird flaw, etc. | . Edge means while they were at it, they also got that many other things done. These should relate to the same attempt and be less Difficult. For example, a mechanic adding a nitro boost and a soup dispenser. Wise characters may break a project into more manageable parts. A good rule of thumb is to reduce the Difficulty by the number of crafters, up to three. For example, an airplane mechanic has their assistant fix the bent propeller while they work on the shot-up gas tank. They now face two separate Checks, but each at two less Difficulty. The disadvantage is that they may still fail one, leaving the project unfinished. Hustle . This Action spends time and effort to recover strained Credit or relations with Contacts. This does not add new Contacts or boost existing ones over your current Credit maximum. The Difficulty for this is either the Travel Difficulty of the area (for Credit) or the Motive of the Contact. A business, trade, or criminal Focus is useful here, depending on the nature of the deal. Check: Focus vs. local Travel Difficulty or Motive of Contact. | Success: Regain one level of Resources or Contact. | Edge: Emerge from the dealings with extra gifts or favors. | Failure: Resources or Contacts remain strained. | Twists: Strain, takes up another Montage, regaining Contact strains Resources, regaining Resources strains Contact, etc. | . Extra gifts or favors from Edge should ideally be something that moves the emergent story along, like important gear or clues. Recover . This is for life and death situations well beyond the ordinary stitching of wounds. Recover Checks Focus vs. local Travel Difficulty or a Fallen patient’s negative Mettle, whichever is greater. Success only stabilizes the patient. Spending all Edge clears one Status: either Shaken, Broken, or Fallen. Failure inflicts a new Shaken/Broken/Fallen Status. if the patient already has all three, they die. Check: Focus vs. Travel Difficulty or negative Mettle. | Success: Patient stable for this Montage. | Edge: spend all Edge and clear one: Shaken, Broken, or Fallen. | Failure: inflict Shaken, Broken, Fallen, or Dead. | Twists: Strain, takes another Montage to find out result, Strain Resources, waste medicine or surgical tools. | . If a Shaken or Broken character opts out of a Recovery Montage, it counts as a Recovery failure. A Fallen character may Recover on their own by Checking Motive vs. the local Travel Difficulty. Do not use Recover to cure an Affliction such as poison or disease. Instead, use a Know Check on a medical Focus to reveal the antidote or cure, if such a thing is available. Relax . Adventure takes its toll on the body and spirit, so it is important to kick back and unwind when the opportunity presents itself. Such opportunities arise as events like a night out on the town, a shopping trip, group meditation, a visit to the hot springs, a birthday party, etc. Those who take part clear one Strain from each Attribute. This gets even better if anyone in the group has a relevant Background, such as when carousing in a city with one of its native sons. In that case, each participant gets to clear one more Strain from a single chosen Attribute. This only applies once even if other Backgrounds could also enhance the outing. There is no Roll or Check for this Montage, use it to explore the lighter sides of your characters. Study . Hunt for clues or knowledge. Consider this Montage a more thorough and time-consuming version of the Know Action. For example, an investigator returning to the crime scene for more clues, an occult researcher hitting the forbidden books section of the library, a clown visiting the hall of eggshell faces to understand his rival, a gambler scouting out the action at a local casino, etc. Study Checks a relevant Focus vs. a fiat Difficulty. Check: Focus vs. Difficulty . | Success: Guide answers two questions or grants two clues. | Edge: expendable bonus dice for related Checks. | Failure: Guide answers only one question or grants a clue. | Twists: Strain, add misleading clue, unwanted attention, -1 fatigue penalty from poor sleep. | . A misleading clue adds one to the number of clues or answers. It is up to the Player to guess, but devious Guides may sow doubt effortlessly by making all the info true. Spend bonus dice from Edge on any upcoming related Check. These disappear when used, as the limited knowledge is no longer fresh. As with Know, frame these questions carefully to get the best info. This can be an immensely useful Montage if the party is stuck on what to do or missed clues earlier. Travel . Travel between areas often just serves as the narrative opening of a new scene. This is perfectly fine. For example, “After a bit of the usual traffic on I-95 you find yourselves eating crabs at the Bulging Bushel.” If the journey is as important as the destination, use this Montage to give it more weight. The players get to make decisions and the Guide gets to add drama with encounters! . Travel is a Group Check of the best navigation or area knowledge Focus, with the Difficulty being how rough the area between is. Success means they arrived safely, and failure a dangerous or troublesome encounter along the way. You can also “zoom in” further, requiring individual Travel Checks to get to interesting places between the start and goal, as in a point-crawl map. In any case, this is meant to enhance not restrict. Parties who really want to go somewhere should be able to “drop a pin” and set an unplanned destination. A single Travel Check can stand for hours, days, or weeks depending on the size of the map. Adventurers “travel on their stomachs.” Lacking food or other needs inflicts a -1 penalty per day to the Travel Check as they scrounge for supplies. This makes it important to prepare well. Check: Focus vs. Difficulty . | Success: arrive at destination safely. | Edge: compare to beat rival parties or foes to destination. | Failure: arrive at destination if you survive an encounter. | Twists: Strain, get lost and move to adjacent area, ambushed later at destination, lose supplies or trade goods. | . An Encounter is an event rolled or chosen by the Guide. These can be dangerous, obnoxious, beneficial, or just interesting. Examples include running across enemies, becoming fatigued, or finding a mysterious statue. Even on a success, the Guide may want to Roll and describe the area to give the players a feel for the setting. One trick is to think up a dangerous Encounter but only describe the telltale signs (tracks, noises, spoor, etc.) of what they would have faced. Rivals or foes can Travel too, giving them their own Edge result. The highest Edge arrives first, which can be important for staking claims or laying ambushes. If that doesn’t apply, they may also meet a helpful NPC, find a hidden area, stumble across an unusual artifact, etc. ",

    "title": "Scenery",
    "content": "Active foes and enemies are not the only danger faced by characters, whether inside or outside of combat. This section holds all sorts of hazardous features to spice up a Scene. Affliction . Virulent plagues, toxic court treachery, a sickly miasma, radioactive death zones, or venomous creatures are ugly ways to die. These differ by potence, method of exposure, interval between Rolls, and effect. Exposure triggers a Roll of 1d6 + Potence, subtracting the victim’s Frame from the result. If the result is positive, it becomes a penalty to all Checks. Write the Affliction status and its current penalty on the character sheet (i.e., “Affliction -2”). If the penalty exceeds the Motive of the character, they suffer the Effect instead. Afflictions are persistent. Every Interval afterward, the Affliction loses one Potence and Rolls again. This ends when Potence drops to zero. Potence restores upon re-exposure. For example, taking another sleep dart or staying in a cave filled with poison gas. Diseases or radiation subtract Poise from the Roll instead of Frame. Roll for these during the next Montage. It is rare for a victim to know exactly how they were exposed, so treat it as a fun, gross mystery. AFFLICTIONS . | Source | Potence | minus | Interval | Effect | . | Common cold | 1 | Poise | Montage | Fallen | . | Monitor lizard bite | 2 | Poise | Montage | Fallen | . | Poison dart | 2 | Frame | Action | Fallen | . | Rattlesnake venom | 3 | Frame | Montage | Fallen | . | Tranquilizer dart | 3 | Frame | Action | Incap. | . You can cure Afflictions with the right antidote, herb, or drug. This drops Potence to zero, ending any penalty or Effect. If uncertain, an Know Check based on medical knowledge can tell what works and if treatment is even available. Cover . Combatants can use objects in the environment to protect themselves from ranged attacks, referred to as taking Cover. There are two types of Cover: Partial and Total. Partial Cover adds +2 to Poise when targeted and Total Cover prevents targeting entirely for both the attacker and the defender. One may pop out of Total Cover and target another character, but it then counts as Partial until the start of their next Action. “Taking cover” in combat only requires a Move into the area with the desired Cover. Whether one has it depends on where the attacker and target are in relation to each other. For example, a stone wall only grants Cover against attackers on the other side. A chain link fence might grant full Cover against throwing axes but only +1 against gunshots, etc. Use your best judgment. Shields are portable Cover, and as such do not stack with Cover. | Partial Cover: +2 to Poise vs. incoming Attacks | Total Cover: no incoming or outgoing Attacks succeed. If you pop out to Attack, it becomes Partial Cover until your next Action. | . Deprivation . Amidst fantastic perils, it is still possible to suffer from the lack of basic needs, such as thirst, hunger, fatigue, and suffocation. An adventurer needs one serving of rations, a liter or so of water each day, roughly six hours of rest, and ample air. Lacking these can have real effects: . | Hunger: each week without food Strains base Frame by one. At 0, the character has starved to death. Each day of normal rations restores 1 Frame. This does not stack with the similar effects of Thirst. | Thirst: each day without water Strains Frame by one. At 0, they die from dehydration. Each day of normal drinking restores 1 Frame. This does not stack with the similar effects of Hunger. | Fatigue: each day without rest inflicts a -1 penalty to all Checks. A full day of rest removes this effect. A fatigued character might fall asleep as a Twist on a failed Check. | Suffocation: a character can hold their breath for 1d6 + Poise Rounds (~6 seconds each) before Incapacitation. They then get another set of rounds equal to Poise before dying. Resuscitation is a normal Recover Check. | . These are not very heroic ways to go and are mainly here to give a good reason to buy rations, shelter, and water. This sort of “resource management” is a whole sub-game some players really enjoy. Falls . Damage of course depends on how far the character fell. This is a Roll of 1d6, adding +1 for every building story or ~5 meters, soaked by Poise. A short fall such as a trip or tumbling into a trench does 1d6, a fall from a second story window or tree does 1d6+1, a fall from a tall tree or a few floors of a building usually does 1d6+3, etc. The most one can take is 1d6+10, such as jumping off a cliff. Survival from terminal velocity is thus possible, but extremely unlikely. The daring may Plummet onto an enemy below, adding one to their Attack bonus for every plus on the falling Roll. They still suffer their own falling damage as normal. | Falls: 1d6 damage, +1 per 5 full meters or so, soaked with Poise. | Plummet: +1 to Attack bonus per 5 full meters fallen. | . Fire . Man’s greatest elemental friend and enemy, fire is a common hazard in games and fiction. This does damage each round until the target escapes the source. Fire damage depends on how big the fire is and how hot it is burning, subtracting Frame as usual. For example, a torch or campfire would do 1d6, a raging Bonfire 1d6+2 or so, and a forge or lava flow 1d6+4. Some targets are naturally flammable, such as wood, mummies, tree-monsters, or rags. Others become flammable via napalm, gasoline, or magical curses. Flammable targets take on the Burning Status, meaning they cannot Rally and continue to take the same damage each Round until extinguished or burnt to cinders. | Fire: 1d6 for small, 1d6+2 for medium, 1d6+4 for large | . Traps . Traps are sinister surprises for daring adventurers; faceless, “ambient” hazards without their own will. Every hidden trap has a Trigger, such as the Character walking down the hallway, turning a door handle, etc. In that moment, it is also possible to detect and avoid it. If successful, the Guide describes the trap and asks how they are escaping it, such as leaping to the side of the pit or pulling away from a door handle. A Character can still suffer if they make a bad choice! . Avoiding a trap is a Move Check upon triggering the device. Assume all characters are looking out for traps as best as they can, with no need to declare it. If a character declares they are the one to scout for traps, graciously let them be the first target of any they run into. An obvious “trap” such as an open pit or lava pool is more of an obstacle the party may just choose to avoid. Some are still irresistible to curious parties. This is also true of already-known hidden traps. | Flooding room: this small adjoining room has a strange idol in the center. If players linger, the doors close and it begins to fill with water, flooding entirely in 5 Rounds. If anyone kneels before the idol the water drains away. Difficulty 8, Drowning. | Pitfall: a carefully weighted trapdoor covers a shaft down to the next floor. Triggered by the first one to walk onto it, anyone nearby could also blunder in. Difficulty 4, 1d6 Falling damage. | Scything blade: a pressure plate in the hallway triggers a massive hidden blade to swing towards the victim. The victim hears a metallic whirring at head height and has a split second to get horizontal and avoid decapitation. Difficulty 6, 2d6 damage. | Tripwire: stout twine between two trees around the bandit camp sets off a crude tin-can alarm. Difficulty 4, alerts the bandits. | . Parties may come up with other ways to escape or avoid traps, and you should reward creative ideas instead of forcing them to play out the trap as written. Visibility . Things like darkness, underbrush, and smoke make tasks related to vision more difficult. In general, dim light is worth a -1 penalty and total darkness a -3. Equipment such as torches or night vision goggles can remove this penalty. Sudden flashes of bright light can also inflict a visibility penalty for the opposite reason. | Lighting or obscurement inflicts -1 to -3 to sight-related Checks. | . ",
