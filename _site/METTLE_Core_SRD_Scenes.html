aria-labelledby="staging"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Staging </h2> <p>A Scene is an imaginary slice of time and space holding in-game events, such as arguments, discoveries, or unexpected encounters. This section describes the background parts of a Scene that help everything else work, such as time, space, and player spotlight.</p> <h3 id="time"> <a href="#time" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="time"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Time </h3> <p>METTLE Core uses only two types of Scenes to keep track of time: <strong><em>Action</em></strong> and <strong><em>Montage</em></strong>.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Action Scenes</strong> are for zoomed-in fast-paced dramatic Actions like fighting, sneaking, and persuasion. These usually take only seconds or minutes.</li> <li><strong>Montage Scenes</strong> are zoomed-out lengthy Montages taking hours to weeks. These include things like travel, healing, training, and shopping. Montages take a long time for the Characters, but to the Players they are mercifully brief.</li> </ul> <p>Less formal means of measuring time can include <strong><em>Session</em></strong>; the entire real-life game day, or <strong><em>Adventure</em></strong>; a series of Sessions. You can always use “realistic” measures such as seconds or days where needed.</p> <h3 id="distance"> <a href="#distance" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="distance"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Distance </h3> <p>Measure distance in <strong><em>Zones</em></strong> for most Scenes. These are flexible spaces, but usually about 10 square meters and 5 meters high. A small closet can be a Zone, as can an amphitheater. Split large areas into several Zones to keep things sensible. Zones can have interesting features or <strong><em>Scenery</em></strong> , such as cover, traps, obstacles, etc.</p> <p>Range and movement vary depending on how many Zones an area holds! Small, cluttered areas are hard to aim around or move through. In these, the effective range of a move or weapon is not going to be as ideal as it would be on a spacious flat plain.</p> <p>This method works well with both “theater of the mind” and actual table maps. Defining an area in Zones helps keep things clear, encourages tactics, and eases narration of their features. If you are using a dry-erase map (and minis!) you can even trace out the Zones in color.</p> <h3 id="initiative"> <a href="#initiative" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="initiative"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Initiative </h3> <p>This decides who-goes-when in Action Scenes where order of action matters. Usually this means combat, but it can apply just as well to closely paced struggles such as social or stealth scenes. Mettle uses “Volleyball” Initiative where the acting character passes the next turn to their target, only choosing another if their target has no Action. The character who starts the conflict triggers <strong><em>Initiative</em></strong>. In case of an argument about who goes first, the Guide should give PCs the privilege.</p> <p>The character taking Initiative gets to take the first Action. If their target has an Action, the target gets to go next. If not, the acting character passes it to anyone else with an Action. In the latter case they may choose friend or foe, so think strategically. If they pass to a Guide NPC, they can be specific <em>or</em> let the Guide figure out which one.</p> <p>Initiative splits an Action Scene into <strong><em>Rounds</em></strong>. When everyone has taken their Action, a new Round begins. Everyone gets their Action back, and the last one to go can now pass Initiative to their target or anyone else - even to themselves again if they targeted no one!</p> <p>One may <strong><em>Wait</em></strong> by selecting a specific Action, such as “Attack” and holding off until the right moment. They may take that Action any time later, even if it interrupts someone else’s. They cannot change the type of Action. If no opportunity arises, they decide at the start of the next Round to keep waiting or rejoin the regular Initiative scheme.</p> <p>Initiative ends when the conflict is over, by whatever means.</p> <blockquote class="highlight"> <ul> <li>First to declare Action triggers Initiative.</li> <li>Target goes next, if they have an Action.</li> <li>Otherwise, pick anyone else with an Action.</li> <li>New Round when no one has Actions left.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p class="text-center"><strong>INITIATIVE</strong></p> <center><img src="images/Initiative.png" title="Initiative flowchart" width="450" /></center> <h2 id="actions"> <a href="#actions" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="actions"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Actions </h2> <p>Most games spend the bulk of their time in <em>Action</em> Scenes. These support acts of combat, persuasion, stealth, intrigue, chases, etc. While it is fun to role-play these feats, it is not important for a player be good at them personally. At a minimum they should describe what they are doing and let their character’s abilities fill in the rest.</p> <p>The default Twist for Actions is Strain, meaning they lose a die from the Attribute used temporarily. The Outcomes section of each Action also lists three likely alternate Twists to liven things up. These are not exhaustive, and many other possibilities exist. Be creative!</p> <p>Everyone gets a free Move before their Action unless Shaken or Broken. They must use a <strong><em>Free Move</em></strong> <em>before</em> the regular Action and cannot use it to pass obstacles. If a character loses their Action for any reason, they do not get their Free Move either.</p> <p>Cohesive groups may use teamwork to combine Actions, such as the Strongest-link and Weakest-link Checks described earlier . This costs both characters their Action but takes place on the same Initiative. If the target had no Action, the character with the higher pool chooses who to pass to.</p> <center><strong>ACTIONS</strong></center> <div class="table-wrapper"><table class="lh-0"> <thead> <tr> <th>Action</th> <th style="text-align: center">Check</th> <th>Successful Outcome</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Attack</td> <td style="text-align: center">Poise + Attack bonus - target Frame, vs. Poise</td> <td>Inflict damage on foe.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Block</td> <td style="text-align: center">Poise + Attack bonus - attacker Frame, vs. Poise</td> <td>Deflect incoming damage.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Dodge</td> <td style="text-align: center">Poise vs. Attack Score</td> <td>Avoid incoming damage.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Know</td> <td style="text-align: center">Focus vs. Difficulty</td> <td>Reveal relevant info.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Move</td> <td style="text-align: center">Poise vs. Difficulty</td> <td>Overcome an obstacle.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Perform</td> <td style="text-align: center">Focus vs. Difficulty</td> <td>Attract positive attention.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Persuade</td> <td style="text-align: center">Nature vs. Motive</td> <td>Sway the minds of others.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Race</td> <td style="text-align: center">Focus vs. Difficulty</td> <td>Take the lead.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Rally</td> <td style="text-align: center">Nature vs. Current Mettle</td> <td>Shrug off damage.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Rattle</td> <td style="text-align: center">Nature vs. Motive</td> <td>Penalize a foe’s next Action.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Sneak</td> <td style="text-align: center">Poise vs. Motive</td> <td>Avoid negative attention.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Use</td> <td style="text-align: center">Focus vs. Difficulty</td> <td>Miscellaneous actions.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <h3 id="attack"> <a href="#attack" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="attack"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Attack </h3> <p>Adventurers get a lot of mileage out of bone-headed violence, so learn this Action well. This applies to any physical strike, whether unarmed, melee, ranged, or even supernatural. Start with your <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span>, add the weapon’s Attack bonus, subtract your target’s <span class="smallcaps">Frame</span>, and then Check what remains versus their <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span>. If successful, inflict one plus Edge damage as described in the Mettle section . Use a relevant military or martial arts related <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span> in place of <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span>, if higher.</p> <p><strong>Check</strong> (<span class="smallcaps">Poise</span> + Attack bonus – target <span class="smallcaps">Frame</span>) vs. target’s <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span></p> <blockquote class="outcomes"> <ul> <li><strong>Success:</strong> Hit and inflict a point of damage.</li> <li><strong>Edge:</strong> <em>Each Edge is an extra point of damage.</em></li> <li><strong>Failure:</strong> Target dodges or parries.</li> <li><strong>Twists:</strong> <em>Strain</em>, <em>drop weapon, lose next Action, waste ammo, etc.</em></li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>There are several broad types of attacks:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Melee Attacks</strong> are close combat strikes on a foe in the same Zone. These can be narrated as decisive strikes or flurries of blows.</li> <li><strong>Ranged Attacks</strong> strike from a Zone or more away. The Difficulty is the greater of either the target’s <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span> or the Range .</li> <li><strong>Grapple Attacks</strong> restrain a foe. This is an unarmed Attack unless using a Grappling weapon. Damage becomes the target’s penalty to all Checks instead. Repeat each Round to continue the hold.</li> <li><strong>Control Attacks</strong> change the position or situation of foes. Instead of inflicting damage these disarm them, provoke them into targeting their attacker next, push or pull them a Zone, etc. If the target refuses the control, they suffer the original damage instead.</li> <li><strong>Subdual Attacks</strong> knock a foe out instead of killing. On a Felling blow, they inflict the Incapacitated status instead of damage. Regular weapons inflict half damage for this, only Stun weapons use full.</li> <li><strong>Vehicle Attacks</strong> like ramming work much like regular Attacks but use current Speed instead of Poise. See Vehicles for details.</li> </ul> <p>You can make multiple attacks by dividing the <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span> pool between them as evenly as possible. For example, an attacker with 5 <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span> and 3 <span class="smallcaps">Frame</span> could make two <strong><em>Split Attacks</em></strong> at 6D (3+3) and 5D (2+3), or other combinations. If a foe Blocks, this interrupts the next split Attack.<span id="_Ref63821460" class="anchor"></span> Modifiers are part of the Attack bonus and do not split.</p> <h3 id="block"> <a href="#block" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="block"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Block </h3> <p>A Block pits your own strike against your foe’s. Just like the Attack it defends against, start with your <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span>, add your weapon’s Attack bonus, subtract the attacker’s <span class="smallcaps">Frame</span>, and then Check what remains versus their <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span>. Edge reduces damage from the incoming blow. If this would negate more than the original damage, it <strong><em>Counters</em></strong> and the original attacker suffers the excess damage!</p> <p>A Block is special in regard to Initiative. It must be the very next Action after the original Attack, even interrupting a Split Attack or negating a Felling Blow. It can also interrupt Initiative to defend an ally in the same Zone, replacing them as the target.</p> <p><strong>Check:</strong> (<span class="smallcaps">Poise</span> + Attack bonus – target <span class="smallcaps">Frame</span>) vs. attacker’s <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span></p> <blockquote class="outcomes"> <ul> <li><strong>Success:</strong> Soak a point of incoming damage.</li> <li><strong>Edge:</strong> <em>Adds to the damage soaked.</em></li> <li><strong>Failure:</strong> Attacker foils your defenses.</li> <li><strong>Twists:</strong> <em>Strain, drop weapon, lose Cover, draw more foes, etc.</em></li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>You can Block against Reach weapons like spears and tasers, but their wielder does not take any Counter damage. This advantage cancels out if both sides are wielding a Reach weapon. You can also Block ranged weapons, but this doubles the Difficulty.</p> <h3 id="dodge"> <a href="#dodge" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="dodge"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Dodge </h3> <p>A last-ditch attempt to get out of harm’s way, eating up all their effort. This works differently than most Actions as it is a Check of <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span> vs. the actual <em>Score</em> of the incoming Attack. If successful, they avoid taking any of that damage. If there is any Edge, the dodger chooses a new target. This new target must be in the same Zone or line of fire. They take damage equal to Edge plus the incoming Attack bonus (only), soaked by <span class="smallcaps">Frame</span>. If there is no Edge, they cannot misdirect the attack.</p> <p>Like Block, a Dodge may negate a Felling blow.</p> <p><strong>Check:</strong> <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span> vs. Attack Score</p> <blockquote class="outcomes"> <ul> <li><strong>Success:</strong> dodge attack entirely.</li> <li><strong>Edge:</strong> <em>Adds to Attack bonus as damage another target.</em></li> <li><strong>Failure:</strong> still hit by attack.</li> <li><strong>Twists:</strong> <em>Strain, lose next Action, lose Cover, etc.</em></li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>The Score of a successful Attack will be higher than the target’s <span class="smallcaps">Poise.</span> This makes Dodge an unlikely act of desperation. However, one can Dodge a failed Attack as well! This makes it easier to trick their flailing foe into striking someone else – another enemy, a bridge support, etc.<span id="_Ref94451177" class="anchor"></span></p> <h3 id="know"> <a href="#know" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="know"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Know </h3> <p>In-character knowledge can uncover helpful facts. For example, a scholar translating hieroglyphs inscribed on a door, a detective inferring weight from a set of footprints, a fashionista guessing how long a corpse’s outfit has been out of style, a gambler trying to spot their opponent’s tell, etc. Know is a Check of <span class="smallcaps">Nature</span> vs. fiat Difficulty, or vs. <span class="smallcaps">Motive</span> if used on a person. If using an investigative or knowledge-related <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span>, it is up to the Player to say why it grants info.</p> <p><strong>Check:</strong> <span class="smallcaps">Nature</span> vs. Difficulty (or vs. <span class="smallcaps">Motive</span> if a person)</p> <blockquote class="outcomes"> <ul> <li><strong>Success:</strong> Guide answers the question to their best knowledge.</li> <li><strong>Edge:</strong> Answers more questions or finer details.</li> <li><strong>Failure:</strong> Guide tells what they should know outright.</li> <li><strong>Twists:</strong> <em>Strain, half-truth, target alerted, one wrong clue, etc.</em></li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>The Player should frame these questions carefully if they want useful info, and Guides should be generous with answers! Always err towards giving out information, as it helps move the story along.</p> <p>Make a Know Check only to <em>understand</em>, not perceive. As such, this does not detect traps, loot, lies, or ambushes. The Guide should usually tell the players what they see without gating it behind a Check.</p> <h3 id="move"> <a href="#move" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="move"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Move </h3> <p>This dedicates an Action towards movement: running, climbing, jumping, swimming, etc. A character usually just takes their Move, only Checking if there is an obstacle. Avoiding traps, ducking through brambles, swimming, clambering over debris, etc. may call for a Check of <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span> vs. a Difficulty set by the Guide. Exceptionally fast characters may move more than one Zone in a single Move, while slow ones may take two Moves or more to cross a single Zone.</p> <p>This Action is special because everyone gets a <strong><em>Free Move</em></strong> before their Action. Using the Free Move then a Move Action is “running,” and crosses two Zones.

For example, you must scale or breach a wall to enter.</li> <li><strong>Scaling:</strong> larger foes count as their own Zone or more to climb upon and deal with riders, etc. Difficulty is the larger foe or mount’s <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span>.</li> <li><strong>Traps</strong> like falls, pits, spikes, lava, etc. do not prevent movement but do cause injury or inconvenience on a failure.</li> </ul> <p><strong><em>Chases</em></strong> have the quarry and pursuers Move through a set of chase Zones, with the quarry deciding where to go.

If no one uses Persuade, the Guide simply role-plays the other character or group’s reaction as they would expect it to play out.</p> <p>Edge makes it more difficult for others to undo the persuasion later. Note this sticky belief in the Resources section of their character sheet. It is now something they “own,” for better or worse.</p> <p>Players on the losing side of Persuasion can either choose to be good sports about it and go along, or outright reject the manipulation.

The fastest racer wins, but if everyone is going the same Speed the winner is the one with the highest Edge. Racers can choose their own Speed up to their vehicle’s max, but current Speed is also the Difficulty on their Handling Check.

Inflicts Edge as penalty to target’s Handling Checks until cleaned. Must be going the same speed as the target and have something to splatter.</li> </ul> <p>Ramming or sideswiping is an Attack. Current speed is king – a slower vehicle cannot normally ram a faster one. Altitude can matter too; a ground vehicle cannot ram an airborne vehicle, except in wild situations.

While they may mark the passage of a long period of time in the setting, they should pass quickly at the table. The Guide typically allows each player a Montage then moves along to the next Scene. This helps with pacing and avoids sessions spent agonizing over minute details.</p> <p>If your party is engaged in Montages of different durations, it is fair for those with shorter tasks to get another Montage. Distractions, emergencies, and procrastination prevent further industry.</p> <center><strong>MONTAGES</strong></center> <div class="table-wrapper"><table class="lh-0"> <thead> <tr> <th>Montage</th> <th style="text-align: center">Check</th> <th>Successful Outcome</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Craft</td> <td style="text-align: center">Focus vs. Difficulty</td> <td>Finish project.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Hustle</td> <td style="text-align: center">Focus vs. Difficulty</td> <td>Regain Credit or Contact.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Recover</td> <td style="text-align: center">Focus vs. Difficulty</td> <td>Stabilize or heal wounds.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Relax</td> <td style="text-align: center">None</td> <td>Restore Strained Attributes.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Study</td> <td style="text-align: center">Focus vs. Difficulty</td> <td>Search for clues or answers.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Travel</td> <td style="text-align: center">Focus vs. Difficulty</td> <td>Arrive safely.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></div> <h3 id="craft"> <a href="#craft" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="craft"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Craft </h3> <p>If players want to try their hand at lengthy undertakings such as art, smithing, repair, writing, lockpicking, etc., they must gather the right materials and make a Check on a relevant <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span>.

These should relate to the same attempt and be less Difficult. For example, a mechanic adding a nitro boost and a soup dispenser.</p> <p>Wise characters may break a project into more manageable parts. A good rule of thumb is to reduce the Difficulty by the number of crafters, up to three. For example, an airplane mechanic has their assistant fix the bent propeller while they work on the shot-up gas tank. They now face two separate Checks, but each at two less Difficulty. The disadvantage is that they may still fail one, leaving the project unfinished.</p> <h3 id="hustle"> <a href="#hustle" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="hustle"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Hustle </h3> <p>This Action spends time and effort to recover strained Credit or relations with Contacts. This does not add new Contacts or boost existing ones over your current Credit maximum. The Difficulty for this is either the Travel Difficulty of the area (for Credit) or the <span class="smallcaps">Motive</span> of the Contact.

Recover Checks <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span> vs. local Travel Difficulty or a Fallen patient’s negative Mettle, whichever is greater. Success only stabilizes the patient. Spending all Edge clears one Status: either Shaken, Broken, or Fallen. Failure inflicts a new Shaken/Broken/Fallen Status. if the patient already has all three, they die.</p> <p><strong>Check:</strong> <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span> vs. Travel Difficulty or negative Mettle.</p> <blockquote class="outcomes"> <ul> <li><strong>Success:</strong> Patient stable for this Montage.</li> <li><strong>Edge:</strong> spend all Edge and clear one: Shaken, Broken, or Fallen.</li> <li><strong>Failure:</strong> inflict Shaken, Broken, Fallen, or Dead.</li> <li><strong>Twists:</strong> <em>Strain, takes another Montage to find out result, Strain Resources, waste medicine or surgical tools.</em></li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>If a Shaken or Broken character opts out of a Recovery Montage, it counts as a Recovery failure. A Fallen character may Recover on their own by Checking <span class="smallcaps">Motive</span> vs. the local Travel Difficulty.</p> <p>Do not use Recover to cure an Affliction such as poison or disease. Instead, use a Know Check on a medical <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span> to reveal the antidote or cure, if such a thing is available.<span id="_Ref109217679" class="anchor"></span></p> <h3 id="relax"> <a href="#relax" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="relax"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Relax </h3> <p>Adventure takes its toll on the body and spirit, so it is important to kick back and unwind when the opportunity presents itself. Such opportunities arise as events like a night out on the town, a shopping trip, group meditation, a visit to the hot springs, a birthday party, etc. Those who take part clear one Strain from each Attribute.</p> <p>This gets even better if <em>anyone</em> in the group has a relevant Background, such as when carousing in a city with one of its native sons. In that case, each participant gets to clear one more Strain from a single chosen Attribute. This only applies once even if other Backgrounds could also enhance the outing.</p> <p>There is no Roll or Check for this Montage, use it to explore the lighter sides of your characters.</p> <h3 id="study"> <a href="#study" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="study"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Study </h3> <p>Hunt for clues or knowledge. Consider this Montage a more thorough and time-consuming version of the Know Action. For example, an investigator returning to the crime scene for more clues, an occult researcher hitting the forbidden books section of the library, a clown visiting the hall of eggshell faces to understand his rival, a gambler scouting out the action at a local casino, etc. Study Checks a relevant <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span> vs. a fiat Difficulty.</p> <p><strong>Check:</strong> <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span> vs. Difficulty</p> <blockquote class="outcomes"> <ul> <li><strong>Success:</strong> Guide answers two questions or grants two clues.</li> <li><strong>Edge:</strong> expendable bonus dice for related Checks.</li> <li><strong>Failure:</strong> Guide answers only one question or grants a clue.</li> <li><strong>Twists:</strong> <em>Strain, add misleading clue, unwanted attention, -1 fatigue penalty from poor sleep.</em></li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>A misleading clue adds one to the number of clues or answers. It is up to the Player to guess, but devious Guides may sow doubt effortlessly by making all the info true.</p> <p>Spend bonus dice from Edge on any upcoming related Check. These disappear when used, as the limited knowledge is no longer fresh.</p> <p>As with Know, frame these questions carefully to get the best info. This can be an immensely useful Montage if the party is stuck on what to do or missed clues earlier.</p> <h3 id="travel"> <a href="#travel" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="travel"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Travel </h3> <p>Travel between areas often just serves as the narrative opening of a new scene. This is perfectly fine. For example, “<em>After a bit of the usual traffic on I-95 you find yourselves eating crabs at the Bulging Bushel</em>.” If the journey is as important as the destination, use this Montage to give it more weight. The players get to make decisions and the Guide gets to add drama with encounters!</p> <p>Travel is a Group Check of the best navigation or area knowledge <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span>, with the Difficulty being how rough the area between is. Success means they arrived safely, and failure a dangerous or troublesome encounter along the way. You can also “zoom in” further, requiring individual Travel Checks to get to interesting places <em>between</em> the start and goal, as in a point-crawl map. In any case, this is meant to enhance not restrict. Parties who really want to go somewhere should be able to “drop a pin” and set an unplanned destination.</p> <p>A single Travel Check can stand for hours, days, or weeks depending on the size of the map. Adventurers “travel on their stomachs.” Lacking food or other needs inflicts a -1 penalty per day to the Travel Check as they scrounge for supplies. This makes it important to prepare well.</p> <p><strong>Check:</strong> <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span> vs. Difficulty</p> <blockquote class="outcomes"> <ul> <li><strong>Success:</strong> arrive at destination safely.</li> <li><strong>Edge:</strong> <em>compare to beat rival parties or foes to destination.</em></li> <li><strong>Failure:</strong> arrive at destination if you survive an encounter.</li> <li><strong>Twists:</strong> <em>Strain, get lost and move to adjacent area, ambushed later at destination, lose supplies or trade goods.</em></li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>An <strong><em>Encounter</em></strong> is an event rolled or chosen by the Guide. These can be dangerous, obnoxious, beneficial, or just interesting. Examples include running across enemies, becoming fatigued, or finding a mysterious statue. Even on a success, the Guide may want to Roll and describe the area to give the players a feel for the setting. One trick is to think up a dangerous Encounter but only describe the telltale signs (tracks, noises, spoor, etc.) of what they would have faced.</p> <p>Rivals or foes can Travel too, giving them their own Edge result. The highest Edge arrives first, which can be important for staking claims or laying ambushes. If that doesn’t apply, they may also meet a helpful NPC, find a hidden area, stumble across an unusual artifact, etc.</p> <h2 id="scenery"> <a href="#scenery" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="scenery"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Scenery </h2> <p>Active foes and enemies are not the only danger faced by characters, whether inside or outside of combat.

These differ by potence, method of exposure, interval between Rolls, and effect.</p> <p>Exposure triggers a Roll of 1d6 + Potence, subtracting the victim’s <span class="smallcaps">Frame</span> from the result. If the result is positive, it becomes a penalty to all Checks. Write the Affliction status and its current penalty on the character sheet (i.e., “Affliction -2”). If the penalty exceeds the Motive of the character, they suffer the Effect instead.</p> <p>Afflictions are persistent. Every Interval afterward, the Affliction loses one Potence and Rolls again. This ends when Potence drops to zero. Potence restores upon re-exposure. For example, taking another sleep dart or staying in a cave filled with poison gas.</p> <p>Diseases or radiation subtract <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span> from the Roll instead of <span class="smallcaps">Frame.</span> Roll for these during the next Montage.

There are two types of Cover: <strong><em>Partial</em></strong> and <strong><em>Total</em></strong>. Partial Cover adds +2 to <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span> when targeted and Total Cover prevents targeting entirely for both the attacker and the defender. One may pop out of Total Cover and target another character, but it then counts as Partial until the start of their next Action.</p> <p>“Taking cover” in combat only requires a Move into the area with the desired Cover. Whether one has it depends on where the attacker and target are in relation to each other. For example, a stone wall only grants Cover against attackers on the other side. A chain link fence might grant full Cover against throwing axes but only +1 against gunshots, etc. Use your best judgment.</p> <p>Shields are portable Cover, and as such do not stack with Cover.</p> <blockquote class="highlight"> <ul> <li><em>Partial Cover:</em> +2 to <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span> vs. incoming Attacks</li> <li><em>Total Cover</em>: no incoming or outgoing Attacks succeed. If you pop out to Attack, it becomes Partial Cover until your next Action.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <h3 id="deprivation"> <a href="#deprivation" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="deprivation"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Deprivation </h3> <p>Amidst fantastic perils, it is still possible to suffer from the lack of basic needs, such as thirst, hunger, fatigue, and suffocation. An adventurer needs one serving of rations, a liter or so of water each day, roughly six hours of rest, and ample air. Lacking these can have real effects:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Hunger:</strong> each week without food Strains base <span class="smallcaps">Frame</span> by one. At 0, the character has starved to death. Each day of normal rations restores 1 <span class="smallcaps">Frame</span>. This <em>does not</em> stack with the similar effects of Thirst.</li> <li><strong>Thirst:</strong> each day without water Strains <span class="smallcaps">Frame</span> by one. At 0, they die from dehydration. Each day of normal drinking restores 1 <span class="smallcaps">Frame</span>. This <em>does not</em> stack with the similar effects of Hunger.</li> <li><strong>Fatigue:</strong> each day without rest inflicts a -1 penalty to all Checks. A full day of rest removes this effect. A fatigued character might fall asleep as a Twist on a failed Check.</li> <li><strong>Suffocation:</strong> a character can hold their breath for 1d6 + <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span> Rounds (~6 seconds each) before Incapacitation. They then get another set of rounds equal to <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span> before dying. Resuscitation is a normal Recover Check.</li> </ul> <p>These are not very heroic ways to go and are mainly here to give a good reason to buy rations, shelter, and water. This sort of “resource management” is a whole sub-game some players really enjoy.</p> <h3 id="falls"> <a href="#falls" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="falls"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Falls </h3> <p>Damage of course depends on how far the character fell. This is a Roll of 1d6, adding +1 for every building story or ~5 meters, soaked by <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span>. A short fall such as a trip or tumbling into a trench does 1d6, a fall from a second story window or tree does 1d6+1, a fall from a tall tree or a few floors of a building usually does 1d6+3, etc. The most one can take is 1d6+10, such as jumping off a cliff. Survival from terminal velocity is thus <em>possible</em>, but extremely <em>unlikely</em>.</p> <p>The daring may <strong><em>Plummet</em></strong> onto an enemy below, adding one to their Attack bonus for every plus on the falling Roll. They still suffer their own falling damage as normal.</p> <blockquote class="highlight"> <ul> <li><strong>Falls:</strong> 1d6 damage, +1 per 5 full meters or so, soaked with <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span>.</li> <li><strong>Plummet:</strong> +1 to Attack bonus per 5 full meters fallen.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <h3 id="fire"> <a href="#fire" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="fire"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Fire </h3> <p>Man’s greatest elemental friend and enemy, fire is a common hazard in games and fiction. This does damage each round until the target escapes the source. Fire damage depends on how big the fire is and how hot it is burning, subtracting <span class="smallcaps">Frame</span> as usual. For example, a torch or campfire would do 1d6, a raging Bonfire 1d6+2 or so, and a forge or lava flow 1d6+4.</p> <p>Some targets are naturally flammable, such as wood, mummies, tree-monsters, or rags. Others become flammable via napalm, gasoline, or magical curses. Flammable targets take on the Burning Status, meaning they cannot Rally and continue to take the same damage each Round until extinguished or burnt to cinders.</p> <blockquote class="highlight"> <ul> <li><strong>Fire:</strong> 1d6 for small, 1d6+2 for medium, 1d6+4 for large</li> </ul> </blockquote> <h3 id="traps"> <a href="#traps" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="traps"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Traps </h3> <p>Traps are sinister surprises for daring adventurers; faceless, “ambient” hazards without their own will. Every hidden trap has a <strong><em>Trigger</em></strong>, such as the Character walking down the hallway, turning a door handle, etc. In that moment, it is also possible to detect and avoid it. If successful, the Guide describes the trap and asks how they are escaping it, such as leaping to the side of the pit or pulling away from a door handle. A Character can still suffer if they make a bad choice!</p> <p>Avoiding a trap is a Move Check upon triggering the device. Assume all characters are looking out for traps as best as they can, with no need to declare it. If a character declares they are the one to scout for traps, graciously let them be the first target of any they run into.</p> <p>An obvious “trap” such as an open pit or lava pool is more of an obstacle the party may just <em>choose</em> to avoid. Some are still irresistible to curious parties. This is also true of already-known hidden traps.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Flooding room:</strong> this small adjoining room has a strange idol in the center. If players linger, the doors close and it begins to fill with water, flooding entirely in 5 Rounds. If anyone kneels before the idol the water drains away. <em>Difficulty 8, Drowning.</em></li> <li><strong>Pitfall:</strong> a carefully weighted trapdoor covers a shaft down to the next floor. Triggered by the first one to walk onto it, anyone nearby could also blunder in. <em>Difficulty 4, 1d6 Falling damage.</em></li> <li><strong>Scything blade:</strong> a pressure plate in the hallway triggers a massive hidden blade to swing towards the victim. The victim hears a metallic whirring at head height and has a split second to get horizontal and avoid decapitation. <em>Difficulty 6, 2d6 damage.</em></li> <li><strong>Tripwire:</strong> stout twine between two trees around the bandit camp sets off a crude tin-can alarm. <em>Difficulty 4, alerts the bandits.</em></li> </ul> <p>Parties may come up with other ways to escape or avoid traps, and you should reward creative ideas instead of forcing them to play out the trap as written.</p> <h3 id="visibility"> <a href="#visibility" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="visibility"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Visibility </h3> <p>Things like darkness, underbrush, and smoke make tasks related to vision more difficult. In general, dim light is worth a -1 penalty and total darkness a -3. Equipment such as torches or night vision goggles can remove this penalty. Sudden flashes of bright light can also inflict a visibility penalty for the opposite reason.</p> <blockquote class="highlight"> <ul> <li>Lighting or obscurement inflicts -1 to -3 to sight-related Checks.</li> </ul> </blockquote> </div> </div> <div class="search-overlay"></div> </div> </body> </html>
