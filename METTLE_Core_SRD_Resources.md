## Armor

If you expect trouble, and you really should, it is best to wear some
sort of armor. Armor adds directly to Mettle, which is otherwise just
<span class="smallcaps">Motive</span>. The tradeoff is the more
protection a set of Armor gives, the more difficult it is to move. In
other words, if Load exceeds the wearer’s <span
class="smallcaps">Frame</span>, it inflicts an encumbrance penalty to
<span class="smallcaps">Poise</span>. This can complicate actions such
as swimming, climbing, travel, and sneaking.

The table below gives examples of armor common to a modern setting, as
well as archaic armor types for comparison.

|:-----------------------------|:-------------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| **Archaic:**                 |               |             |             |
|            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leather armor     |       +1      |       1     |       2     |

| **Modern:**                  |               |             |             |
|         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Kevlar vest (BP)    |       +1      |       0     |       3     |

Armor may be very well-crafted or ***Superior***, subtracting 1 from
Load and adding one to Cost. It may also be ***Inferior***, adding 1 to
Load and subtracting one from Cost.

***BP*** armor is “bulletproof,” meaning it halves the first firearm
damage it takes. Afterward, it only functions as regular armor.

Your setting may also have armor with special perks, such as magical,
rescue, or powered suits.

##  Weapons

The following weapons chart gives examples of some of the more popular
weapons. Each weapon has a Name to describe it, its Attack bonus, any
special qualities, its Load, and Cost.

**Attack bonus** adds to <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span> on the
Attack Check before subtracting your opponent’s <span
class="smallcaps">Frame</span>. For most muscle-powered weapons, this is
<span class="smallcaps">Frame</span> plus the modifier listed in the
weapons table below. For firearms, this is equal to the listed value
alone. A relevant <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span> can replace <span
class="smallcaps">Poise</span>, if higher. Attack bonus stacks with
situational modifiers.

### Specials

- **2H** takes two hands to wield.
- **Ammo** is the number of shots before reloading with a *Use* Action.
- **Block** adds a bonus to Block Checks when wielded.
- **Burst** raises the Attack bonus by that amount, hitting harder and
easing Split Attacks. +1/+2/+3 uses 5/10/20 bullets respectively.
- **Cover** adds a Cover bonus to <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span>
when targeted by an Attack.
- **Grapple** use the weapon’s Attack bonus on Grapple Checks.
- **Entangle** incapacitates instead of doing damage: Check Poise vs. the
original “damage” each Round to escape.
- **Inferior:** weapons are shoddy; lower Attack bonus and Cost by one.
- **Range** is how far one can throw or shoot the weapon. This replaces
the target’s Poise as Difficulty, if higher. If no range is given,
assume the weapon can be lobbed at 4 Difficulty per Zone away.
>-   Range **S** (Short) is 3 Difficulty per Zone away.
>-   Range **M** (Medium) is 2 Difficulty per Zone away.
>-   Range **L** (Long) is 1 Difficulty per Zone away.

- **Reach** weapons do not take return damage from a Block made against
them unless the blocker is also using a Reach weapon.
- **Scoped** weapons reduce the penalty for Range (only) by that amount.
- **Stun** weapons do their full damage when making Subdual attacks. Some
can only make Subdual attacks, shown as “(only).”
- **Superior** weapons are well-made; raise Attack bonus and Cost by one.
- **Wrap** weapons are flexible and ignore a foe’s Cover bonuses.

*\*Special features are for a “typical” modern weapon of its kind. If
modeling a specific weapon, adjust as needed.*

## Equipment

Part of the joy of making a setting is thinking about what tools are
available to help those within it achieve their goals. Different items
will be available depending on the portrayed time period.

### Miscellaneous Items

Aside from being vital flavor text about who the character is, items on
the character sheet can enable or enhance actions. Only jury-rigged
equipment does not provide a bonus. For example, a set of proper
lockpicks grants a +1 bonus to pick locks. Making do with a hairpin
grants no bonus, and a fancy set could grant +2 or more. Very poor gear
might inflict a penalty, but this should be rare.

### Standard Kits

These are some standard personal possessions characters in certain
settings may start out with. These are painless ways to make sure a
character does not start out missing obvious things.

- **Adventurer’s kit (Fantasy):** this is a small backpack filled with the
most basic things an adventurer may need. Includes a *Small backpack*,
*Field Rations (3 days), Waterskin (1 L), Torch (1), Sack, Cord (10 m),
Flint & Steel.*
- **Pockets (Modern):** the contents of a modern person’s pockets.
Includes *Keys, Wallet or Purse, Cash, Credit cards, and ID.* Likely to
also include a *cell phone* in more recent modern games.

## Hirelings

No man is an island, and even a well-rounded party can find they lack
ability or patience for certain tasks. In general, you get what you pay
for. A Hireling’s <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span>
 is usually equal to two plus the Funds spent
hiring them (Funds+2), with other Attributes being average unless the
Guide wants to spice them up.

- **Lawyer:** adventurers get into all sorts of shenanigans, lawbreaking,
and general stupidity. Fair or foul, a lawyer can get them out of it.
Keeping one on retainer can make escaping the consequences of your own
actions faster and easier.
- **Local Guide:** hiring a local or street urchin to show you around a
new place is a great way to avoid trouble, but they can also expose you
to scams. Most want repeat business however and try to take advantage of
your naivety in ways you don’t notice.
- **Servant:** somehow, party members are notoriously unreliable for basic
tasks. This can be a driver, butler, porter, or other such useful
person.

While not technically hirelings, the party may also bribe passerby or
lay-abouts. These watch a vehicle, reveal info, carry messages, etc.
This is also a great way for the Guide to pass on much-needed clues from
a source the party has no reason to mistrust.

## Mounts

Riding atop a mount is a great advantage. In combat, the mount and rider
count as a single unit. A mounted rider may use the mount's Speed
instead of their own and enjoys Partial Cover (+2). The two must share
the same Action but may split Attacks between them. Otherwise, treat
them as individuals.

The mount uses a simplified NPC Pool  for Checks
it could reasonably make, with their <span
class="smallcaps">Frame</span> in parentheses. The rider may use their
riding-related <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span> to get the Mount to
do something it does not want to, such as leaping over a dangerous
obstacle, learning a trick, running to exhaustion, or staying in a
battlefield. Treat this as a Persuade Check (rider’s <span
class="smallcaps">Focus</span> vs. mount’s Pool<span
class="smallcaps">)</span>. A trained mount behaves differently in
certain conditions. For example, a war horse does not balk at combat or
gunfire.

{: .text-center}
**MOUNTS**

- **Camel:** *Pool 4(<span class="smallcaps">Frame</span> 7), Speed 2,
Attack (kick 7D)*. Ships of the desert, hardy and stubborn.
- **Donkey:** *Pool 4(<span class="smallcaps">Frame</span> 5), Speed 2,
Attack (kick 5D)*. Like a small but sturdy horse. Shines on rough
terrain as a pack or riding animal.
- **Elephant:** *Pool 4(<span class="smallcaps">Frame</span> 12), Speed 1,
Attack (stomp 12D)*. Mighty and steady.
- **Horse:** *Pool 4 (<span class="smallcaps">Frame</span> 7), Speed 3,
Attack (kick 7D)*. A strong, fast, and awe-inspiring mount for the ages.
- **Mule**: *Pool 4(<span class="smallcaps">Frame</span> 7), Speed 2,
Attack (kick 7D)*. A sturdy mount or beast of burden with a lot of
attitude.

## Vehicles

Airplanes, mecha, or bulldozers have ratings for their ease of handling,
maximum speed, and <span class="smallcaps">Frame</span>. When necessary,
the driver or pilot Checks their <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span>
vs. their current Speed. Current Speed also serves as the Difficulty for
foes to target it in combat.

- **Handling:** how easily it turns compared to others of its class. The
modifier adds to the relevant <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span> on
Checks made to control it.
- **Speed:** how fast it can go. This affects the Move and Race Actions in
slightly different ways. Current Speed acts as a Move in Zones and as a
substitute <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span> score.
- **<span class="smallcaps">Frame</span>:** Size and weight. Armored
vehicles just add <span class="smallcaps">Frame</span> instead of using
character armor rules.

The terrain favored by a vehicle should be obvious from their type.
Unsuitable terrain counts as an obstacle or impassible.

### Vehicle Cover

Vehicles with cabins grant Total Cover and can pop out to target others
with Partial Cover. Exposed vehicles only grant Partial Cover.

### Vehicle Damage

Vehicles do not have Mettle. Instead, every point of damage reduces
their Handling by one until repaired. An air vehicle must land if its
Handling pool drops to half or lower.

### Crashes

A Crash is when a vehicle loses control and hits an obstacle, usually by
accident. This affects speedy and delicate vehicles far more than slow
and sturdy ones. A vehicle suffers a Roll of 1d6 plus Speed as damage,
soaked by <span class="smallcaps">Frame</span> as usual. Occupants will
suffer 1d6 plus Speed damage, soaked with their own <span
class="smallcaps">Frame</span>(s). Occupants will take half damage if
wearing seatbelts or other safety equipment.

{: .highlight}
>-   **Crash:** 1d6 + Speed - <span class="smallcaps">Frame</span> damage

### Ramming

This purposeful assault turns your vehicle into a deadly but fragile
weapon. Check the vehicle’s current Speed, with an Attack bonus equal to
its Frame, minus the target’s Frame, versus its current Speed. Ramming a
pedestrian is versus their Poise.

The ramming vehicle may suffer collateral damage from this risky stunt.
Handle this as a Twist on a failed Ramming Check. This has the same
effect as a Crash, above.

In a head on collision, add the speed of both vehicles together.

{: .highlight}
>-   **Ram Vehicle:** \[Speed + <span class="smallcaps">Frame</span> –
    target <span class="smallcaps">Frame</span>\] vs. current Speed
>-   **Ram Pedestrian:** \[Speed + <span class="smallcaps">Frame</span> –
    target <span class="smallcaps">Frame</span>\] vs. <span
    class="smallcaps">Poise</span>

### Speed Scaling

Vehicles with high Speeds are actually much faster than their Move in
Zones. This is due to the difficulty of accelerating within the confines
of a small arena. If they break out into more spacious areas the Zones
also expand to accommodate their full speed. Race Checks are a good
example of this.
