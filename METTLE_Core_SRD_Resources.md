## Armor

The covers of pulp adventures are adorned with lurid images of sweaty men and women of action. Shirts ripped, bodices straining, nary a flak jacket in sight. Don't let that fool you though, these stories are also rife with chain undershirts and iron plates secretly saving these glistening oafs from doom.

So if you expect trouble, and you really should, it is no shame to wear some sort of armor. Armor adds to FRAME for Soaking damage. The tradeoff is the more protection a set of Armor gives, the more it burdens the wearer. In other words, if Load exceeds the wearer's FRAME, it lowers POISE by that amount. This can complicate actions such as swimming, climbing, and sneaking.

The table below gives examples of armor common to a modern setting, as well as archaic armor types for comparison.

|------------------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| **Armor**        | **Soak** | **Load** | **Cost** |
| Archaic:         |          |          |          |
| Light (Leather)  | +1       | 1        | 2        |
| Medium (Chain)   | +2       | 2        | 3        |
| Heavy (Plate)    | +3       | 3        | 4        |
| Modern:          |          |          |          |
| Kevlar vest (BP) | +1       | 0        | 3        |
| Flak Jacket      | +2       | 1        | 3        |
| Riot gear        | +3       | 2        | 4        |


***BP*** armor is "bulletproof," meaning it halves the first firearm damage it takes after Soak. Afterward, it only functions as regular armor.

## Weapons

The following weapons chart gives examples of the more popular weapons. Each has a Name, Hit, DAM, special qualities, Load, and Cost. **Hit** is the Attack or Block bonus of the weapon. **Damage (DM)** is the base damage amount before Edge and Soak.

### Specials

-   **2H** takes two hands to wield.
-   **Ammo** is the number of shots before reloading with a *Use* Action.
-   **Blast** also inflicts 1d6 + DM as Area Attack to others in the target Zone.
-   **Burst** grants +1D to each Split Attack for every 5 ammo spent. This special bonus applies only to Split Attacks, so Bursts require at least two (split) Attacks.
-   **Defend** adds a bonus to Defend Checks when wielded.
-   **Entangle** Grapples using the weapon's Hit and DM and does not take a further Action to maintain the Difficulty increase each round. Target escapes if they beat the increased Difficulty on a Move Check.
-   **Grapple** use the weapon's Hit and DM on Grapple Attacks.
-   **Range** is how many Zones one can shoot or throw the weapon. Beyond this, they fire at +1 Difficulty per Zone, up to twice the Range. A zero (0) Range means it Attacks normally within the Zone but is Difficulty +1 to hit targets in the next. A weapon with no listed Range can be thrown in the same Zone but loses its Hit bonus.
-   **Reach** weapons steal Initiative from an attacker, unless out of Actions or the attacker is also using a Reach weapon.
-   **Scoped** weapons add that many Zones to Range at the cost of an Action.
-   **Shield** adds a bonus to POISE defense versus incoming Attacks.
-   **Soft:** less-lethal weapons like fists or whips. Half damage *after* Soak.
-   **Stun** weapons do their full damage when making Stun attacks. If it *only* Stuns, it does damage but will always Stun on a Felling blow.
-   **Wrap** weapons are flexible and ignore a foe's Shield Difficulty.

*\*Special features are for a "typical" modern weapon of its kind. If modeling a specific weapon, compare it to the actual weapon and adjust as needed. For example, a smaller "Walther PPK" pistol might do 1 less DM and hold 7 ammo.*

## Equipment

Part of the joy of making a setting is thinking about what tools are available to help those within it achieve their goals. Different items should be available depending on the time period portrayed.

### Miscellaneous Items

Aside from being vital flavor text, items can enable or enhance actions. Only jury-rigged equipment does not provide a bonus. For example, a set of proper lockpicks grants a +1 bonus to pick locks. Making do with a hairpin grants no bonus, and a fancy set could grant +2 or more. Very poor gear might inflict a penalty, but this should be rare.

### Medicine

These keep an adventurer up and running, and need to be listed as they have specific effects within the system. Cost is for a day's dose, and high doses do not stack effectively -- the benefits and drawbacks cancel out.

-   **Activated charcoal:** negates upcoming Affliction damage from most ingested poisons. Load 0, Resources 1.
-   **Antibiotics:** negates upcoming Affliction damage from bacterial diseases. Load 0, Resources 2.
-   **Painkillers, over the counter:** ignore one die of penalty from negative Mettle. Load 0, Resources 1.
-   **Painkillers, prescription:** ignore two dice of penalty from negative Mettle. Load 0, Resources 2.
-   **Stimulant, over the counter:** ignore a die of Fatigue drain from Concept. Includes coffee. Load 0, Resources 1.
-   **Stimulant, prescription:** ignore two dice of Fatigue drain from Concept, and one die of penalty from negative Mettle. Load 0, Resources 2.

### Standard Kits

These are standard personal possessions characters in certain settings may start with. These are painless ways to make sure a character does not start out missing obvious things.

-   **Explorer's pack:** basic things an adventurer may need. Includes a *Small backpack*, *Snacks (1 day of rations), Canteen (\<1 L), Flashlight, Sack, paracord (\~10 m), knife, lighter, first aid kit, light blanket, notebook, pen, and pencil.* Load 1, Resources 2.
-   **Pockets/Purse:** the contents of a modern person's pockets. Includes *Keys, Wallet, Cash, Credit cards, and ID.* Likely to also include a *cell phone* in more recent modern games. Load: 0, Resources 1.

## Hirelings

No man is an island, and even a well-rounded party can find they lack the ability or patience for certain tasks. In general, you get what you pay for. A Hireling's CONCEPT is usually equal to the Funds spent hiring them or better, with other Attributes being average unless the Guide wants to spice them up.

-   **Lawyer:** adventurers get into all sorts of shenanigans, lawbreaking, and general stupidity. Fair or foul, a lawyer can get them out of it. Keeping one on retainer can make escaping the consequences of your actions faster and easier.
-   **Local Guide:** hiring a local or street urchin to show you around a new place is a great way to avoid trouble, but they can also expose you to scams. Most want repeat business however and try to take advantage of your naivety in ways you don't notice.
-   **Official:** having a politician, policeman, or well-placed bureaucrat in your pocket is *de rigueur* at higher Resource levels. Your backer may have a few they can share but remember -- so may your foes. Maybe even the same ones!
-   **Servant:** somehow, party members are notoriously unreliable for basic tasks. This can be a driver, butler, porter, or other such useful person.

While not technically hirelings, the party may also bribe passersby or layabouts. These watch a vehicle, reveal info, carry messages, etc. This is also a great way for the Guide to pass on much-needed clues from a source the party has no reason to mistrust.

## Mounts

Riding atop a mount is a great advantage. In combat, the mount and rider count as a single unit. A mounted rider may use the mount's Speed instead of their own and enjoys Partial Cover (+2). The two must share the same Action but may Split Attacks between them. Otherwise, treat them as individuals.

 The mount uses a simplified NPC Pool, with their FRAME in parentheses. The rider may use their riding-related Concept to get the Mount to do something it does not want to, such as leaping over a dangerous obstacle, learning a trick, running to exhaustion, or staying in a battlefield. Treat this as a Parley Check (rider's Concept vs. mount's Pool). A trained mount behaves differently in certain conditions. For example, a war horse does not balk at combat or gunfire.

{: .text-center}
**MOUNTS**

-   **Camel:** *Pool 4(FRAME 7), Speed 2, Attack (kick 7 DAM)*. Ships of the desert, hardy and stubborn.
-   **Donkey:** *Pool 4(FRAME 5), Speed 2, Attack (kick 5 DAM)*. Like a small but sturdy horse. Shines on rough terrain as a pack or riding animal.
-   **Elephant:** *Pool 4(FRAME 12), Speed 1, Attack (stomp 12 DAM)*. Mighty and steady.
-   **Horse:** *Pool 4 (FRAME 7), Speed 3, Attack (kick 7 DAM)*. A strong, fast, and awe-inspiring mount for the ages.
-   **Mule**: *Pool 4(FRAME 7), Speed 2, Attack (kick 7 DAM)*. A sturdy mount or beast of burden with a lot of attitude.

## Vehicles

Cars, airplanes, tanks, and bulldozers are great fun to destroy. If they don’t finish an adventure as burnt-out wrecks, you may be doing it wrong. Until then, they have ratings for their ease of handling, maximum speed, and FRAME. When necessary, the driver or pilot Checks their Concept vs. their current Speed.

-   **Handling**: how easily it turns compared to others of its class. The modifier adds to the relevant Concept on Checks to control it.
-   **Speed**: how fast it can go. This affects the Move and Race Actions in slightly different ways. Current Speed acts as a Move in Zones and as a substitute POISE score.
-   **FRAME**: Size and weight, same as for Characters.

The terrain favored by a vehicle should be obvious from its type. Unsuitable terrain increases Difficulty or is impassible, depending.

### Vehicle Cover

Vehicles with cabins grant Total Cover and can pop out to target others with Partial Cover. Exposed vehicles only grant Partial Cover.

### Vehicle Damage

A Vehicle is an extension of the driver and uses their Mettle! This means that swapping out battered drivers can be a smart move even if it takes both of their Actions. This only goes so far - a Felling blow applies to the vehicle instead of the driver. A vehicle can be Fallen or Staggered just like a character. Any penalties from negative Mettle affect Handling until repaired, even if the drivers change.

### Crashes

A Crash is when a vehicle loses control and hits an obstacle or rolls over avoiding one. The vehicle takes damage equal to 1d6 + its Speed, with no Soak! Occupants also Roll this damage but get to Soak with their FRAME and armor, if any. If not wearing seatbelts or similar safety devices, count Speed as double for occupants.

{: .highlight}
- **Crash:** Damage is 1d6 + current Speed, no Soak.
- **Occupants:** Damage 1d6 + current Speed, soaked by FRAME.

### Ramming

This purposeful assault turns your vehicle into a deadly weapon. Against another vehicle, make an Attack Check of the Vehicle's Handling versus the target's current Speed. Damage is FRAME + Speed + Edge, soaked by the target's FRAME. Ramming a pedestrian is the same, but versus their POISE instead of current Speed.

The ramming vehicle may suffer collateral damage from this risky stunt. They take automatic damage in return equal to the target's FRAME + Speed, soaked by their FRAME + Edge.

In a head-on collision, add the speed of both vehicles together.

{: .highlight}
- **Ram Attack:** Handling vs. current Speed (or POISE for pedestrians).
- **Ram damage:** FRAME + Speed + Edge, soaked by target's FRAME.
- **Return damage:** target FRAME + Speed, soaked by your FRAME + Edge.

### Speed Scaling

Vehicles with high Speeds are actually much faster than their given Move in human-scaled Zones. This is due to the difficulty of accelerating within the confines of a small arena. If they break out into more spacious areas the Zones also expand to accommodate their full speed. Race Checks are a good example of this.
