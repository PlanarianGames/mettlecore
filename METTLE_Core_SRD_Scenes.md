*An RPG is a different beast than theater, but some of its familiar terms can be useful for keeping track of things. If your gaming group enjoys certain types of scenes, steer the game towards more of them. If lucky and creative, they may find themselves in unusual situations not described here. In those happy cases, you are on your own.*

## Staging

A Scene is an imaginary slice of time and space holding in-game events, such as arguments, discoveries, or unexpected encounters. This section describes the background parts of a Scene that help everything else work, such as time, space, and player spotlight.

### Time

The amount of time a given scene takes in the game world is flexible and depends on what ***Actions*** (p.40) the Players and Guide are using. Fast-paced feats like fighting and sneaking only take seconds or minutes. Lengthy events like traveling and recovery can take days or weeks in-game. To the players themselves, most Actions should take about the same amount of time to resolve, barring disagreements.

For the most part, this game uses real-world time measurements like days, weeks, months, etc. A notable exception is ***Rounds***. These are about six seconds long and come in handy for fast-paced combat Scenes after Initiative (p.38) comes into play.

Less formal means of measuring time can include ***Session***; the entire real-life game day, or ***Campaign***; a series of Sessions. Don't get too hung up on time unless there is something urgent creating pressure.

### Distance

Measure distance in ***Zones*** for most Scenes. These are flexible spaces, but usually about 10 square meters and 5 meters high. A small closet can be a Zone, as can an amphitheater. Split large areas into several Zones to keep things sensible. Zones can have interesting features or ***Scenery*** (p.52), such as cover, traps, obstacles, etc.

A normal character can move into an adjacent Zone for free. They must spend a Move Action (p.45) to get past an obstacle or run another Zone. Some creatures and most vehicles can move more Zones.

Range and movement vary depending on how many Zones an area holds! Small, cluttered areas are hard to aim around or move through. In these, the effective range of a move or weapon is not going to be as ideal as it would be on a spacious flat plain.

### Initiative

This decides who goes when in Scenes where the order of action matters. Usually, this means combat, but it can apply just as well to tightly-paced social or stealth scenes. Mettle uses "Volleyball" Initiative where the acting character passes the next turn to their target, only choosing another if their target has no Action. The character who starts the conflict triggers Initiative. In case of an argument about who goes first, the Guide should give PCs the privilege.

The character taking Initiative gets to take the first Action. If their target has an Action, the target gets to go next. If not, the acting character passes it to anyone else with an Action. In the latter case, they may choose friend or foe, so think strategically. If they pass to a Guide NPC, they can be specific *or* let the Guide figure out which one.

Initiative splits an Action Scene into Rounds. When everyone has taken their Action, a new Round begins. Everyone gets their Action back, and the last one to go can now pass Initiative to their target or anyone else - even to themselves again if they targeted no one!

One may ***Wait*** by selecting a specific Action, such as "Attack" and holding off until the right moment. They may take that Action any time later, even interrupting someone else's. They cannot change the type of Action. If no opportunity arises, they choose at the start of the next Round to keep waiting or rejoin the regular Initiative scheme.

Initiative ends when the conflict is over, by whatever means.

{: .highlight}

**INITIATIVE**

### Free Move

In Scenes with Initiative, everyone gets a ***Free Move*** (p.45) before their Action, unless Staggered. If there is an obstacle, they must spend their actual Move Action to cross it. If a character loses their Action for any reason, they do not get their Free Move either.

If a character Splits their Action (below) they do not get an extra Free Move to go with it. They do get to decide which Split Action it precedes, however.

### Split Actions

It is possible to ***Split*** an action, which means you take more than one Action by splitting the dice pool between them. Use the highest pool and divide the dice up as evenly as possible between them. If one Action has a much smaller pool, do not give it more dice than its original pool. For example, an attacker with a 5D Attack could make two Attacks, one at 3D and the other at 2D. If a foe Blocks, this interrupts the next Split Action until resolved.

Initiative passes to the target normally after each Split Action, if possible. The splitter still counts as having their Action, so they get to take the next part of their Split Action when the Initiative comes back to them. If their target had no Actions, they get to choose themselves and take their Split Actions back-to-back.

You do have to decide what your Actions are when you initially Split the pool. If the chaos of combat makes an action impossible, you lose the dice dedicated to it. For example, an adventurer firing a pistol at a cyborg gorilla while jumping their motorcycle off a ramp would split their dice for it. If the gorilla yanks them off the motorcycle after their shot, they lose the dice they would have used to control the motorcycle on their next Split Action. Least of their problems.

### Downtime

Sometimes a Scene will take a long time, perhaps days or months. This is common when recovering negative Mettle, undertaking a long project, or traveling. Those not involved may wonder what they are doing during that time. The problem is that this tends to become an adventure that leaves out the character(s) tied up in the long action, or a lengthy argument about how they fill their time.

METTLE Core is an action-adventure game about pressing ever onward, not dealing with leisure time. If the characters want to adventure, the one taking the long action may agree to play a spare PC or NPC. Better, they may each just accept a ***Downtime Voucher***. This is a token they can spend later to retroactively reveal something helpful they did during the Downtime. For example, bought a speedboat or added a new feature to their utility belt. These can be real lifesavers.

## Actions

Most games spend a good amount of time resolving *Actions.* While it is fun to role-play these out to the hilt, it would be unfair to demand that a player be good at them *personally*. At a minimum they should describe what they are doing and let their character's abilities fill in the rest.

Do not fret if you run into events in the game that genuinely call for a Check but are not listed here. Just as described in the Checks section; find a likely Attribute for the pool, take a guess at the Difficulty, and make up your mind about what success and failure mean. Then just throw the dice. If it's something you end up doing a lot, save some time by writing up a formal Action for it. The ones to follow are just the most common actions, pre-baked so you don't have to cook them up from scratch every time.

The default Twist for Actions is Delay, meaning they lose their next Action because they are still dealing with the consequences of their last. The Outcomes section of each Action also lists a few likely alternate Twists to liven things up. These are not exhaustive, and many other possibilities exist. Be creative!

### Aid

This is for life-and-death situations well beyond the ordinary stitching of flesh wounds. This only works on the Staggered or Fallen; those with less severe injuries recover with less drama. Recover Checks Concept vs. current (0 or negative) Mettle, treating it as positive for this purpose. Success stabilizes the patient for the time being, and any Edge heals that much negative Mettle. Failure means the patient was too far gone to save, try not to blame yourself.

**Check:** Concept vs. current Mettle.

{: .outcomes }

> -   **Success:** the patient is alive and somewhat stable.
> -   **Edge:** each restores a point of Mettle.
> -   **Failure:** patient succumbs to their wounds and dies.
> -   **Twists:** *Delay, patient disfigured, lower Resources, waste medicine or surgical tools.*

Beyond this, recovery takes time, a scant resource in adventures. Make this Check each week, risking death to recover more Mettle. If a PC is too debilitated, the best option is to play another character until they are back on their feet. The Guide can just handwave that they are OK by the next campaign. Holding up the whole party to heal up one character is a real drag. Don't do that to your fellow Players.

### Attack

Adventurers get a lot of mileage out of bone-headed violence, so learn this Action well. This applies to any physical strike, whether unarmed, melee, ranged, or even supernatural. Attackers Check Nature vs. their target's Poise. If successful, they inflict the weapon's DM plus any Edge as damage to Mettle. Use a relevant military or martial arts-related Concept in place of Nature, if higher.

**Check** Nature vs. Poise

{: .outcomes }

> -   **Success:** Hit and inflict the weapon's DM on the target.
> -   **Edge:** *adds to DM.*
> -   **Failure:** Target dodges or parries.
> -   **Twists:** *Delay*, *drop weapon, also hits unintended target (1d6+DM) waste ammo, etc.*

-   **Melee** **Attacks** are close combat strikes on a foe in the same Zone. Narrate these as decisive strikes or flurries of blows, as you please.

-   **Ranged** **Attacks** travel through Zones up to the weapon's Range. Past this, they face +1 Difficulty per Zone, up to twice the Range.

-   **Area Attacks** skip the Check and just hit everyone in a Zone or more, Damage is 1d6 + DM for each target. If there was an original target hit by the main Attack, it does not also suffer the Area Attack.

-   **Grapple Attacks** raise Difficulty instead of doing damage. This goes by raw Frame; most weapons and armor do not count for either side. The target cannot Move without a Move Check vs. the Difficulty increase, but if successful they also escape the hold. The target also escapes if the Grappler does not reapply the hold next Round.

-   **Disarm** **Attacks** are melee or ranged Attacks that separate the target from their weapon. A Felling blow causes the target to drop the weapon instead of taking damage. An unarmed disarm may ***Seize*** the weapon and wield it themselves.

-   **Stun** **Attacks** knock a foe out instead of killing, such as by a pommel strike, sleeper hold, etc. A Felling blow inflicts the Incapacitated Status instead of damage. Weapons without the *Stun* feature do half damage after Soak on Stun Attacks.

-   **Unarmed Attacks** are less lethal. These have the (relatively!) *Soft* feature, inflicting only half damage after Soak.

-   **Vehicle Attacks** like ramming work much like regular Attacks but factor in current Speed. See Vehicles (p.65) for details.

### Defend

A last-ditch attempt to save your skin by reducing the damage from a successful incoming Attack. This takes the form of blocking, parrying, or dodging -- whichever would be more effective or narratively sensible. Check Poise vs. the attacker's Nature. If successful, raise Soak by two against that Attack, plus one for every Edge. Even a failed Defend raises Soak by one.

Defend must be the very next Action after the original Attack, one cannot wait until later in the Round. This can "undo" the effect of what would otherwise have been a Felling blow. It can also interrupt Initiative to defend an ally in the same Zone, replacing them as the target.

**Check:** Poise vs. Nature

{: .outcomes }

> -   **Success:** +2 to Soak
> -   **Edge:** *adds to Soak.*
> -   **Failure:** +1 to Soak
> -   **Twists:** *Delay, drop weapon, lose Cover, draw more foes, etc.*

Special weapons may grant a bonus to Defend, such as Shields and parrying daggers.

### Know

In-character knowledge can uncover helpful facts. For example, a scholar translating hieroglyphs inscribed on a door, a detective gauging weight from a set of footprints, a party using the library to delve for clues, a fashionista guessing how long a corpse's outfit has been out of style, a gambler trying to spot a tell, etc. Know is a Check of Concept vs. a fiat Difficulty for facts, or vs. Motive if used to judge a person.

**Check:** Concept vs. Difficulty (or vs. Motive if a person)

{: .outcomes }

> -   **Success:** Guide answers the question in line with the character's best understanding.
> -   **Edge:** Answers more questions or finer details.
> -   **Failure:** Guide tells what their CONCEPT should know outright.
> -   **Twists:** *Delay, half-truth, target alerted, one wrong clue, etc.*

The Player should frame these questions carefully if they want useful info, and Guides should be generous with answers! Having the right Concept can grant better information even without a Check. Always err towards giving out information, as it helps move the story along.

Make a Know Check only to *understand*, not perceive. As such, this does not detect traps, loot, lies, or ambushes. The Guide should usually tell the players what they see without gating it behind a Check. As such, even a failure grants them info -- usually the info they got from the Guide by listening before they reached for the dice.

### Move

This dedicates an Action towards movement: running, climbing, jumping, swimming, etc. A character usually just takes their Move, only Checking if there is an obstacle. Avoiding traps, ducking through brambles, swimming, clambering over debris, etc. may call for a Check of Poise vs. a Difficulty set by the Guide. Exceptionally fast characters may move more than one Zone in a single Move, while slow ones may take two Moves or more to cross a single Zone.

This Action is special because everyone gets a ***Free Move*** before their Action (never after!). Using the Free Move then a Move Action is "running," and crosses two Zones. If faced with an obstacle, they lose the Free Move and use their regular Move Action to overcome it.

**Check:** POISE vs. Difficulty

{: .outcomes }

> -   **Success:** Overcome obstacle or trap.
> -   **Edge:** compare to see who got there first.
> -   **Failure:** Stopped by an obstacle or triggered trap.
> -   **Twists:** *Delay, drop item, cause a hazard, reveal location, etc.*

Obstacles, scaling larger foes, and traps can be worth a Move Check:

-   **Obstacles** like walls, rivers, brambles, etc. hinder moves into the Zone. For example, you must scale or breach a wall to enter.

-   **Scaling:** larger foes count as their own Zone or more to climb upon and deal with riders, etc. The Difficulty is the larger creature's Poise.

-   **Traps** like falls, pits, spikes, lava, etc. do not prevent movement but do cause injury or inconvenience on a failure.

***Chases*** have the quarry and pursuers Move through a set of chase Zones, with the quarry deciding where to go. How well they overcome obstacles decides who wins.

### Parley

Haggling, seduction, diplomacy, lies, threats, bribery, and negotiation are all good alternatives or preludes to battle. This is not mind-control and merely shifts the social situation in favor of the winner. Parley is a Check of Nature vs. Motive. The side with more leverage may get a bonus or better narrative outcome.

**Check:** Nature vs. Motive (or highest Motive of an audience)

{: .outcomes }

> -   **Success:** The social situation sways in your favor.
> -   **Edge:** Adds to Difficulty to persuade otherwise later.
> -   **Failure:** The social situation plays out as it would.
> -   **Twists:** *Delay, lose Contact, offend ally, reveal secret, etc.*

Success shifts the narrative for the better, but the views of those
involved still depend on the actual argument. If no one uses Persuade,
the Guide simply role-plays the other character or group's reaction as
they would expect it to play out.

Edge makes it more difficult for others to undo the persuasion later.
Note this sticky belief in the Resources section of their character
sheet. It is now something they "own," for better or worse.

Players on the losing side of Persuasion can either choose to be good
sports about it and go along, or outright reject the manipulation. Going
along with it can easily justify an XP highlight!

### Race

It takes a steady hand to keep control during a high-speed chase or aerial dogfight. The fastest racer wins, but if everyone is going the same Speed the winner is the one with the highest Edge. Racers can choose their own Speed up to their vehicle's max, but the current Speed is also the Difficulty of their Handling (p.65) Check. The Guide can also spice up the course with obstacles, which add 1d6 to the Difficulty.

**Check:** Handling (CONCEPT) vs. current Speed

{: .outcomes }

> -   **Success:** Kept up pace and stayed in control.
> -   **Edge:** Their lead on other racers in the same Speed group.
> -   **Failure:** Crash damage to vehicle and occupants
> -   **Twists:** *Delay (sidetracked next Round, lose lead), create obstacle, waste fuel, lose parts, etc.*

You can spend Edge on stunts instead of playing fair like a chump:

-   **Steady:** smooth out the ride and line up the target; add Edge as a bonus to any occupant's Attacks on their target.

-   **Swerve:** juking or angling, Edge increased Difficulty of any foe's Attack on the vehicle until your next Action.

-   **Splatter:** skid up mud or dirt onto the windshield. Inflicts Edge as Difficulty to target's Handling Checks until cleaned. Must be going the same speed as the target and have something to splatter.

Ramming or sideswiping is an Attack. Current speed is king -- a slower vehicle cannot normally ram a faster one. Altitude can matter too; a ground vehicle cannot ram an airborne vehicle, except in wild situations. The Guide must wield their best judgment as usual.

### Rally

Restores Mettle by shaking off the pain of flesh wounds. This is a Check of Motive vs. the current Mettle of the character, restoring one or two points of Mettle, more with Edge. This cannot restore negative Mettle -- at that point, the harm is lasting. Rallies are vital for staying in a long fight against powerful foes.

**Check:** Motive vs. current Mettle

{: .outcomes }

> -   Success:\*\* Restore two Mettle and end the effect of a Rattle.
> -   **Edge:** *Restore that many extra Mettle.*
> -   **Failure:** Restore only one point of Mettle.
> -   **Twists:** *Delay, reveal secret, offend ally, draw more foes, etc.*

If a gracious ally who passed Initiative to them has a higher Nature than the rallier's Motive, the Rallying character may Check on that instead. Play it up as words of encouragement.

A successful Rally also clears the effects of a Rattle, below:

### Rattle

Taunting, threatening, trash-talking, and demoralizing an enemy. This Action is only effective if the target can understand the onslaught of indignity hurled at them. Rattle is a Check of Nature vs. current Mettle, but a spiteful, authoritative, or comedic Concept can do. This afflicts them with self-doubt and raises the Difficulty of their Rallies. A thoroughly rattled foe is inclined to surrender or flee.

**Check:** Nature vs. current Mettle

{: .outcomes }

> -   **Success:** Foe adds +2 Difficulty to Rallies.
> -   **Edge:** *each Edge further raises Rally Difficulty by one.*
> -   **Failure:** Foe adds only +1 Difficulty to Rallies.
> -   **Twists:** *Delay, reveal secret, offend ally, draw more foes, etc.*

The Difficulty increase lasts until the end of the Scene or a successful Rally. They may gripe about it later but the actual sting fades with time.

Difficulty increases from multiple rattlers do not stack. A target only feels the most hurtful heckling that Scene.

### Sneak

Moving silently and hiding in shadows are great ways to evade foes and get into places you aren't supposed to be. This only allows you to *remain* unnoticed by others. It is not possible if someone is looking right at you, or you do not have anywhere to hide. This is a Check of Poise vs. Motive, or the highest Motive in a group. A Stealthy Concept can swap in for Poise, if higher.

**Check:** Poise vs. Motive

{: .outcomes }

> -   **Success:** Remain unnoticed by your foes.
> -   **Edge:** Adds to DM during Surprise, steal or plant more small items, etc.
> -   **Failure:** They notice you.
> -   **Twists:** *Delay, leave telltale clues, end up in different area, drop gear, etc.*  

-   **Hiding** is a matter of finding Cover rather than a checked Action. If their seekers move into a position where the Cover would fail, the hider can try a Sneak Check to slip away. The better the hiding spot, the less likely they will need to slip away from it.

-   **Surprise** attacks can trigger after a successful Sneak. The surprised side goes a Round without an Action. Next Round things go back to normal for the survivors.

-   **Steal/Plant** small objects under 1 Load, with Edge adding extras. Good for framing a suspect, snitching a set of keys, leaving trackers, live grenades, etc. Often done instead of an Attack or Defense, leaving the seemingly victorious foe unaware of their loss or gain.

### Travel

Traveling between areas often just serves as the narrative opening of a new scene. This is perfectly fine. For example, "*After a bit of the usual traffic on I-95, you find yourselves eating crabs at the Bulging Bushel*." If the journey is as important as the destination, use this Action to give it more weight. The players get to make decisions and the Guide gets to add drama with encounters!

The lead traveler Checks their best navigation or area knowledge Concept, with the Difficulty being how troublesome the area between is. Success means the group arrived safely, and failure is an encounter along the way. You can also "zoom in," requiring individual Travel Checks to get to places *between* the start and goal. In any case, this is meant to enhance not restrict. Parties who want to go somewhere else should be able to "drop a pin" and set an unplanned destination.

A single Travel Check can stand for hours, days, or weeks depending on the distance and vehicles. Adventurers "travel on their stomachs." Lacking rations inflicts a +1 Difficulty per day without as they bicker and scrounge for supplies. It is important to prepare well.

**Check:** Concept vs. Difficulty

{: .outcomes }

> -   **Success:** arrive at destination safely.
> -   **Edge:** *compare to beat rival parties or foes to destination.*
> -   **Failure:** arrive at your destination if you survive an encounter.
> -   **Twists:** *Delay, get lost and move to an adjacent area, ambushed later at the destination, lose supplies or trade goods.*

An ***Encounter*** is an event rolled or chosen by the Guide. Whether enemies, obstacles, fortune, or misfortune, they tend to eat up precious time and resources. Examples include running across a hostile patrol, becoming fatigued, getting a flat tire, or finding a mysterious statue. Even on a success, the Guide may want to roll on an encounter table and describe the telltale signs (tracks, noises, spoor, etc.) of what they would have faced.

Rivals or foes can Travel too, giving them their own Edge result. The highest Edge arrives first, which can be important for staking claims or laying ambushes.

### Use

This catch-all Action covers miscellaneous feats, normally using a device, tool, or item. For example, pulling a sticky lever, forging a famous painting, starting an unfamiliar vehicle, fixing a car, picking a lock, etc. For trivial but Round-consuming Actions like reloading a weapon or pulling a lever, this is usually unchecked. Otherwise, Check a relevant Concept vs. a fiat Difficulty. Let a failure stand - move the story along instead of allowing retries.

**Check:** FOCUS vs. Difficulty

{: .outcomes }

> -   **Success:** Uses the item properly.
> -   **Edge:** Quicker, better, with flair, etc.
> -   **Failure:** The task is harder than it looks.
> -   **Twists:** Delay (gonna need more time here!), break tools, attract
>     unwanted attention.\*

## Scenery

Active foes and enemies are not the only danger faced by characters,
whether inside or outside of combat. This section holds all sorts of
hazardous features to spice up a Scene.

Active foes and enemies are not the only dangers to face. This section holds all sorts of hazardous features to spice up a Scene.

### Affliction

Adventurers should be wary of venomous snakes, blowgun darts, the miasma of the tomb, and a "mickey" slipped in their drink! These impart a sense of dreadful urgency to any scene. If exposed, the Guide Rolls the Dose dice and applies the effects:

-   **Disease:** Roll Dose, the sufferer cannot Rally and takes 1 damage each day, up to the result. Some diseases take weeks or months instead.

-   **Poison:** Roll Dose and subtract the victim's Frame. If positive, they cannot Rally and take 1 damage each Round, up to the result.

-   **Tranquilizers:** as poison, but the Dose result also raises the victim's Check Difficulties. This tends to put them out of action before death.

Afflictions end when cured or the damage runs out. The victim may then Rally back, if not at negative HP. To keep the suspense alive, the Guide should keep the Dose result secret. Even so, a Know Check based on medical knowledge may suggest some treatments or how long it will take for the affliction to run its course.

<strong>SAMPLE AFFLICTIONS</strong>
</center>

|                     |              |          |                     |
|---------------------|:------------:|:--------:|---------------------|
| **Source**          |   **Type**   | **Dose** | Symptoms            |
| Common cold         |   Disease    |  1d6-3   | Cough, sneezing     |
| Monitor lizard bite |   Disease    |  1d6-1   | Swelling, gangrene  |
| Curare dart         |    Poison    |   2d6    | Shortness of breath |
| Cobra venom         |    Poison    |   2d6    | Fatigue, swelling   |
| Tranquilizer dart   | Tranquilizer |   1d6    | Fatigue, clumsiness |

Adjust the dosage for the victim's size using the Frame Conversion chart (p.89) as a loose guide. For example, the Dose must be at least 3d6 (3-18) for a 12 Frame elephant.

{: .highlight }
\>- **Affliction:** Roll Dose for max damage, lose Rally if any damage.
\>- ***Poisons*** do 1/Round, ***Diseases*** do 1/Day, ***Tranqs*** also add Difficulty.

### Cover

Combatants can use nearby obstacles to protect themselves from ranged attacks, referred to as taking ***Cover***. There are two ways to use Cover: ***Partial*** and ***Total***. Taking Partial Cover adds +2 to Poise Difficulty vs. incoming attacks. Total Cover prevents targeting entirely for both attacker and defender. Area Attacks do half damage in Partial Cover and none in Full Cover. One may pop out of Total Cover and target another character, but it then counts as only Partial until their next Action.

Whether one has Cover depends on where the attack is coming from. For example, a stone wall only grants Cover against those on the other side. A chain link fence grants full Cover against throwing axes but only +1 against gunshots, etc. If Cover is easily penetrated by an attack, such as a wooden wall versus a tank cannon, it can only ever count as Partial. Use your judgment as always.

{: .highlight }
\>- *Partial Cover:* +2 to POISE vs. incoming Attacks, half damage from Area Attacks.
\>- *Total Cover*: cannot target or be targeted.

### Deprivation

Amid fantastic perils, it is still possible to suffer from basic thirst, hunger, fatigue, and suffocation. An adventurer needs one serving of rations, a canteen (liter or so) of water each day, roughly six hours of rest, and ample air. Lacking these can have real effects:

-   **Hunger:** each week without food lowers Frame by one. At zero, the character has starved to death. Each day of normal rations restores 1 Frame lost to hunger.

-   **Thirst:** each day without water lowers Poise by one. At zero, they die from dehydration. Each day of normal drinking restores 1 Poise lost to thirst.

-   **Fatigue:** each day without rest lowers Concept by one. At zero, they die from exhaustion. A full day of rest removes this effect. A fatigued character might fall asleep as a Twist on a failed Check.

-   **Suffocation:** one can hold their breath in strenuous conditions for 1d6 rounds, or 2d6 if they have time for deep breaths beforehand. Beyond this, they lose 1 Mettle per round.

These are not very heroic ways to go but they give good reason to buy rations, shelter, and water. This sort of "resource management" is a whole sub-game some players enjoy. The Guide may find them useful for evoking a sense of urgency in extreme conditions.

{: .highlight }
\>- **Hunger:** -1 Frame per week, restored by food.
\>- **Thirst:** -1 Poise per day, restored by water.
\>- **Fatigue:** -1 Focus per day, restored by sleep.
\>- **Suffocation:** Hold breath for 1d6 Rounds before taking damage.

### Falls

Damage of course depends on how far the character fell: 1d6, plus 2 for every full building story or \~5-meter vertical Zone.  This damage Soaks with Poise instead of Frame. For example, a short fall like tumbling into a trench does 1d6+2, a second-story window or tree does 1d6+4, a tall tree or several floors of a building may do 1d6+8, etc. Terminal velocity limits damage to 1d6 + 20, such as skydiving without a parachute.

Hard ground like concrete or rubble may inflict +1, spikes or traps Roll separate damage (1d6+), water may be -2, jumping purposefully instead of falling reliably grants -2, etc.

The truly daring may ***Plummet*** onto an enemy below, raising their DM by two for every Zone fallen. They still suffer their own falling damage, soaked by Poise as usual.

{: .highlight }
\>- **Falls:** 1d6 damage, +2 per Zone (\~5m), Soak with POISE.
\>- **Plummet:** +2 to DM per full Zone fallen.

### Fire

Fire does damage 1d6 or more damage each round until the target escapes it. This damage depends on how big the fire is and how hot it is burning, soaked by Frame and armor. For example, a torch or campfire would do 1d6 or so, a raging Bonfire 2d6, and a forge or lava flow 3d6 or more.

Some targets are naturally flammable, such as wood, mummies, tree monsters, or rags. Others become so via napalm, gasoline, or magical curses. Flammable targets take on the Burning Status, meaning they cannot Rally and continue to take the same damage each Round until extinguished or burnt to cinders.

{: .highlight }
\>- **Fire:** 1d6 or more damage, soaked by FRAME.

### Traps

Traps are sinister surprises for daring adventurers; faceless, "ambient"
hazards without their own will. Every hidden trap has a ***Trigger***,
such as the Character walking down the hallway, turning a door handle,
etc. In that moment, it is also possible to detect and avoid it. If
successful, the Guide describes the trap and asks how they are escaping
it, such as leaping to the side of the pit or pulling away from a door
handle. A Character can still suffer if they make a bad choice!

Avoiding a trap is a Move Check upon triggering the device. Assume all
characters are looking out for traps as best as they can, with no need
to declare it. If a character declares they are the one to scout for
traps, graciously let them be the first target of any they run into.

An obvious "trap" such as an open pit or lava pool is more of an
obstacle the party may just *choose* to avoid. Some are still
irresistible to curious parties. This is also true of already-known
hidden traps.

-   **Flooding room:** this small adjoining room has a strange idol in the
    center. If players linger, the doors close and it begins to fill with
    water, flooding entirely in 5 Rounds. If anyone kneels before the idol
    the water drains away. *Difficulty 8, Suffocation.*
-   **Pitfall:** a carefully weighted trapdoor covers a shaft down to the
    next floor. Triggered by the first one to walk onto it, anyone nearby
    could also blunder in. *Difficulty 4, 1d6+2 Falling damage.*
-   **Scything blade:** a pressure plate in the hallway triggers a massive
    hidden blade to swing towards the victim. The victim hears a metallic
    whirring at head height and has a split second to get horizontal and
    avoid decapitation. *Difficulty 6, 2d6 damage.*
-   **Tripwire:** stout twine between two trees around the bandit camp sets
    off a crude tin-can alarm. *Difficulty 4, alerts the bandits.*

Parties may come up with other ways to escape or avoid traps, and you
should reward creative ideas instead of forcing them to play out the
trap as written.

### Visibility

Darkness, underbrush, and smoke make tasks related to vision more difficult. In general, dim light is +1 Difficulty and total darkness +3. Equipment such as torches or night vision goggles can prevent this. Sudden flashes of bright light can also hinder visibility.
