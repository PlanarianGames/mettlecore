## Staging

A Scene is an imaginary slice of time and space holding in-game events,
such as arguments, discoveries, or unexpected encounters. This section
describes the background parts of a Scene that help everything else
work, such as time, space, and player spotlight.

### Time

METTLE Core uses only two types of Scenes to keep track of time:
***Action*** and ***Montage***.

- **Action Scenes** are for zoomed-in fast-paced dramatic Actions
 like fighting, sneaking, and persuasion. These
usually take only seconds or minutes.
- **Montage Scenes** are zoomed-out lengthy Montages
taking hours to weeks. These include things like travel, healing,
training, and shopping. Montages take a long time for the Characters,
but to the Players they are mercifully brief.

Less formal means of measuring time can include ***Session***; the
entire real-life game day, or ***Adventure***; a series of Sessions. You
can always use “realistic” measures such as seconds or days where
needed.

### Distance

Measure distance in ***Zones*** for most Scenes. These are flexible
spaces, but usually about 10 square meters and 5 meters high. A small
closet can be a Zone, as can an amphitheater. Split large areas into
several Zones to keep things sensible. Zones can have interesting
features or ***Scenery*** , such as cover, traps,
obstacles, etc.

Range and movement vary depending on how many Zones an area holds!
Small, cluttered areas are hard to aim around or move through. In these,
the effective range of a move or weapon is not going to be as ideal as
it would be on a spacious flat plain.

This method works well with both “theater of the mind” and actual table
maps. Defining an area in Zones helps keep things clear, encourages
tactics, and eases narration of their features. If you are using a
dry-erase map (and minis!) you can even trace out the Zones in color.

### Initiative

This decides who-goes-when in Action Scenes where order of action
matters. Usually this means combat, but it can apply just as well to
closely paced struggles such as social or stealth scenes. Mettle uses
“Volleyball” Initiative where the acting character passes the next turn
to their target, only choosing another if their target has no Action.
The character who starts the conflict triggers ***Initiative***. In case
of an argument about who goes first, the Guide should give PCs the
privilege.

The character taking Initiative gets to take the first Action. If their
target has an Action, the target gets to go next. If not, the acting
character passes it to anyone else with an Action. In the latter case
they may choose friend or foe, so think strategically. If they pass to a
Guide NPC, they can be specific *or* let the Guide figure out which one.

Initiative splits an Action Scene into ***Rounds***. When everyone has
taken their Action, a new Round begins. Everyone gets their Action back,
and the last one to go can now pass Initiative to their target or anyone
else - even to themselves again if they targeted no one!

One may ***Wait*** by selecting a specific Action, such as “Attack” and
holding off until the right moment. They may take that Action any time
later, even if it interrupts someone else’s. They cannot change the type
of Action. If no opportunity arises, they decide at the start of the
next Round to keep waiting or rejoin the regular Initiative scheme.

Initiative ends when the conflict is over, by whatever means.

{: .highlight}
>- First to declare Action triggers Initiative.
>- Target goes next, if they have an Action.
>- Otherwise, pick anyone else with an Action.
>- New Round when no one has Actions left.

**INITIATIVE**

##  Actions

Most games spend the bulk of their time in *Action* Scenes. These
support acts of combat, persuasion, stealth, intrigue, chases, etc.
While it is fun to role-play these feats, it is not important for a
player be good at them personally. At a minimum they should describe
what they are doing and let their character’s abilities fill in the
rest.

The default Twist for Actions is Strain, meaning they lose a die from
the Attribute used temporarily. The Outcomes section of each Action also
lists three likely alternate Twists to liven things up. These are not
exhaustive, and many other possibilities exist. Be creative!

Everyone gets a free Move  before their Action
unless Shaken or Broken. They must use a ***Free Move*** *before* the
regular Action and cannot use it to pass obstacles. If a character loses
their Action for any reason, they do not get their Free Move either.

Cohesive groups may use teamwork to combine Actions, such as the
Strongest-link and Weakest-link Checks described earlier
. This costs both characters their Action but
takes place on the same Initiative. If the target had no Action, the
character with the higher pool chooses who to pass to.

### Attack

Adventurers get a lot of mileage out of bone-headed violence, so learn
this Action well. This applies to any physical strike, whether unarmed,
melee, ranged, or even supernatural. Start with your <span
class="smallcaps">Poise</span>, add the weapon’s Attack bonus, subtract
your target’s <span class="smallcaps">Frame</span>, and then Check what
remains versus their <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span>. If
successful, inflict one plus Edge damage as described in the Mettle
section . Use a relevant military or martial arts
related <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span> in place of <span
class="smallcaps">Poise</span>, if higher.

**Check** (<span class="smallcaps">Poise</span> + Attack bonus – target
<span class="smallcaps">Frame</span>) vs. target’s <span
class="smallcaps">Poise</span>

{: .outcomes }

>- **Success:** Hit and inflict a point of damage.
>- **Edge:** *Each Edge is an extra point of damage.*
>- **Failure:** Target dodges or parries.
>- **Twists:** *Strain*, *drop weapon, lose next Action, waste ammo,
etc.*

There are several broad types of attacks:

- **Melee Attacks** are close combat strikes on a foe in the same Zone.
These can be narrated as decisive strikes or flurries of blows.
- **Ranged Attacks** strike from a Zone or more away. The Difficulty is
the greater of either the target’s <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span>
or the Range .
- **Grapple Attacks** restrain a foe. This is an unarmed Attack unless
using a Grappling weapon. Damage becomes the target’s penalty to all
Checks instead. Repeat each Round to continue the hold.
- **Control Attacks** change the position or situation of foes. Instead of
inflicting damage these disarm them, provoke them into targeting their
attacker next, push or pull them a Zone, etc. If the target refuses the
control, they suffer the original damage instead.
- **Subdual Attacks** knock a foe out instead of killing. On a Felling
blow, they inflict the Incapacitated status instead of damage. Regular
weapons inflict half damage for this, only Stun weapons use full.
- **Vehicle Attacks** like ramming work much like regular Attacks but use
current Speed instead of Poise. See Vehicles  for
details.

You can make multiple attacks by dividing the <span
class="smallcaps">Poise</span> pool between them as evenly as possible.
For example, an attacker with 5 <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span> and
3 <span class="smallcaps">Frame</span> could make two ***Split
Attacks*** at 6D (3+3) and 5D (2+3), or other combinations. If a foe
Blocks, this interrupts the next split Attack.<span id="_Ref63821460"
class="anchor"></span> Modifiers are part of the Attack bonus and do not
split.

### Block

A Block pits your own strike against your foe’s. Just like the Attack it
defends against, start with your <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span>,
add your weapon’s Attack bonus, subtract the attacker’s <span
class="smallcaps">Frame</span>, and then Check what remains versus their
<span class="smallcaps">Poise</span>. Edge reduces damage from the
incoming blow. If this would negate more than the original damage, it
***Counters*** and the original attacker suffers the excess damage!

A Block is special in regard to Initiative. It must be the very next
Action after the original Attack, even interrupting a Split Attack or
negating a Felling Blow. It can also interrupt Initiative to defend an
ally in the same Zone, replacing them as the target.

**Check:** (<span class="smallcaps">Poise</span> + Attack bonus – target
<span class="smallcaps">Frame</span>) vs. attacker’s <span
class="smallcaps">Poise</span>

{: .outcomes }

>- **Success:** Soak a point of incoming damage.
>- **Edge:** *Adds to the damage soaked.*
>- **Failure:** Attacker foils your defenses.
>- **Twists:** *Strain, drop weapon, lose Cover, draw more foes, etc.*

You can Block against Reach weapons like spears and tasers, but their
wielder does not take any Counter damage. This advantage cancels out if
both sides are wielding a Reach weapon. You can also Block ranged
weapons, but this doubles the Difficulty.

### Dodge

A last-ditch attempt to get out of harm’s way, eating up all their
effort. This works differently than most Actions as it is a Check of
<span class="smallcaps">Poise</span> vs. the actual *Score* of the
incoming Attack. If successful, they avoid taking any of that damage. If
there is any Edge, the dodger chooses a new target. This new target must
be in the same Zone or line of fire. They take damage equal to Edge plus
the incoming Attack bonus (only), soaked by <span
class="smallcaps">Frame</span>. If there is no Edge, they cannot
misdirect the attack.

Like Block, a Dodge may negate a Felling blow.

**Check:** <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span> vs. Attack Score

{: .outcomes }

>- **Success:** dodge attack entirely.
>- **Edge:** *Adds to Attack bonus as damage another target.*
>- **Failure:** still hit by attack.
>- **Twists:** *Strain, lose next Action, lose Cover, etc.*

The Score of a successful Attack will be higher than the target’s <span
class="smallcaps">Poise.</span> This makes Dodge an unlikely act of
desperation. However, one can Dodge a failed Attack as well! This makes
it easier to trick their flailing foe into striking someone else –
another enemy, a bridge support, etc.<span id="_Ref94451177"
class="anchor"></span>

### Know

In-character knowledge can uncover helpful facts. For example, a scholar
translating hieroglyphs inscribed on a door, a detective inferring
weight from a set of footprints, a fashionista guessing how long a
corpse’s outfit has been out of style, a gambler trying to spot their
opponent’s tell, etc. Know is a Check of <span
class="smallcaps">Nature</span> vs. fiat Difficulty, or vs. <span
class="smallcaps">Motive</span> if used on a person. If using an
investigative or knowledge-related <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span>,
it is up to the Player to say why it grants info.

**Check:** <span class="smallcaps">Nature</span> vs. Difficulty (or vs.
<span class="smallcaps">Motive</span> if a person)

{: .outcomes }

>- **Success:** Guide answers the question to their best knowledge.
>- **Edge:** Answers more questions or finer details.
>- **Failure:** Guide tells what they should know outright.
>- **Twists:** *Strain, half-truth, target alerted, one wrong clue, etc.*

The Player should frame these questions carefully if they want useful
info, and Guides should be generous with answers! Always err towards
giving out information, as it helps move the story along.

Make a Know Check only to *understand*, not perceive. As such, this does
not detect traps, loot, lies, or ambushes. The Guide should usually tell
the players what they see without gating it behind a Check.

### Move

This dedicates an Action towards movement: running, climbing, jumping,
swimming, etc. A character usually just takes their Move, only Checking
if there is an obstacle. Avoiding traps, ducking through brambles,
swimming, clambering over debris, etc. may call for a Check of <span
class="smallcaps">Poise</span> vs. a Difficulty set by the Guide.
Exceptionally fast characters may move more than one Zone in a single
Move, while slow ones may take two Moves or more to cross a single Zone.

This Action is special because everyone gets a ***Free Move*** before
their Action. Using the Free Move then a Move Action is “running,” and
crosses two Zones. One cannot take their Free Move after an Action or to
Move through an obstacle, as below.

**Check:** <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span> vs. Difficulty

{: .outcomes }

>- **Success:** Overcome obstacle or trap.
>- **Edge:** Bonus to later ally’s Move or penalty to pursuing foes.
>- **Failure:** Stopped by an obstacle or triggered trap.
>- **Twists:** *Strain, drop item, cause a hazard, reveal location, etc.*

Obstacles, scaling larger foes, and traps can be worth a Move Check:

- **Obstacles** like walls, rivers, brambles, etc. hinder moves into the
Zone. For example, you must scale or breach a wall to enter.
- **Scaling:** larger foes count as their own Zone or more to climb upon
and deal with riders, etc. Difficulty is the larger foe or mount’s <span
class="smallcaps">Poise</span>.
- **Traps** like falls, pits, spikes, lava, etc. do not prevent movement
but do cause injury or inconvenience on a failure.

***Chases*** have the quarry and pursuers Move through a set of chase
Zones, with the quarry deciding where to go. How well they overcome
obstacles decides who wins.

### Perform

Impress, sway or draw a crowd with talents like singing, comedy,
oration, dancing, instruments, etc. Perform Checks a specific <span
class="smallcaps">Focus</span> vs. the highest <span
class="smallcaps">Motive</span> in a crowd. Performers may get a bonus
if they know what a crowd wants to see or hear. Performances also make a
great distraction so other party members can do nefarious things.

**Check:** <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span> vs. <span
class="smallcaps">Motive</span> (or highest <span
class="smallcaps">Motive</span> in the audience)

{: .outcomes }

>- **Success:** Gather an interested crowd.
>- **Edge:** New fans add bonus to future performances.
>- **Failure:** Little interest or attention.
>- **Twists:** *Strain, attract trouble, waste resources, break gear,
etc.*

A performance troupe or musical band should lump their efforts into a
group Check. Twists and Strain affect one character who volunteers. For
example, the bass player trips off the stage, the drummer falls
unconscious, etc. If outright missing a part (drummer, straight-man,
etc.) the Check may incur a penalty.

Edge may result in gaining followers. There’s always a chance an NPC
they meet later is a fan!

### Persuade

Haggling, seduction, diplomacy, lies, threats, bribery, negotiation,
parley, etc. All are valid alternatives or preludes to battle. This is
not mind-control, and merely shifts the social situation in favor of the
winner. Persuade is a Check of <span class="smallcaps">Nature</span> vs.
<span class="smallcaps">Motive</span>. The side with more leverage may
get a bonus or better narrative outcome.

**Check:** <span class="smallcaps">Nature</span> vs. <span
class="smallcaps">Motive</span> (or highest <span
class="smallcaps">Motive</span> in the audience)

{: .outcomes }

>- **Success:** The social situation sways in your favor.
>- **Edge:** Adds to Difficulty to persuade otherwise later.
>- **Failure:** The social situation plays out as it would.
>- **Twists:** *Strain, Strain Contact, offend ally, reveal secret, etc.*

Success shifts the narrative for the better, but the views of those
involved still depend on the actual argument. If no one uses Persuade,
the Guide simply role-plays the other character or group’s reaction as
they would expect it to play out.

Edge makes it more difficult for others to undo the persuasion later.
Note this sticky belief in the Resources section of their character
sheet. It is now something they “own,” for better or worse.

Players on the losing side of Persuasion can either choose to be good
sports about it and go along, or outright reject the manipulation. Going
along with it can easily justify an XP highlight!

### Race

It takes a steady hand to keep control during a high-speed chase or
aerial dogfight. The fastest racer wins, but if everyone is going the
same Speed the winner is the one with the highest Edge. Racers can
choose their own Speed up to their vehicle’s max, but current Speed is
also the Difficulty on their Handling  Check. The
Guide can also spice up the course with obstacles, which add 1d6 to the
Difficulty.

**Check:** Handling vs. current Speed

{: .outcomes }

>- **Success:** Kept up pace and stayed in control.
>- **Edge:** Their lead on other racers in the same Speed group.
>- **Failure:** Crash damage to vehicle and occupants
.
>- **Twists:** *Strain, create obstacle, waste fuel, lose parts, etc.*

You can spend Edge on stunts instead of playing fair like a chump:

- **Steady:** smooth out the ride and line up the target; add Edge as
bonus to any occupant’s Attacks on their target.
- **Swerve:** juking or angling, add Edge as penalty to any foe’s Attack
on the vehicle until your next Action.
- **Splatter:** skid up mud or dirt onto the windshield. Inflicts Edge as
penalty to target’s Handling Checks until cleaned. Must be going the
same speed as the target and have something to splatter.

Ramming or sideswiping  is an Attack. Current
speed is king – a slower vehicle cannot normally ram a faster one.
Altitude can matter too; a ground vehicle cannot ram an airborne
vehicle, except in wild situations. The Guide must call on their best
judgment as usual.

### Rally

Restores Mettle by shaking off the pain of flesh wounds. This is a Check
of <span class="smallcaps">Nature</span> vs. the current Mettle of the
character. One can only Rally if *chosen* to receive Initiative by
another. They are too distracted to Rally if they took Initiative
because a friend or foe *targeted* them. This makes teamwork among
Players especially important for Rallies.

**Check:** <span class="smallcaps">Nature</span> vs. current Mettle

{: .outcomes }

>- **Success:** Clear a point of damage.
>- **Edge:** *Clear that many extra points of damage.*
>- **Failure:** Do not clear any damage.
>- **Twists:** *Strain, reveal secret, offend ally, draw more foes, etc.*

If the gracious ally who passed Initiative to them has a higher <span
class="smallcaps">Nature</span>, the Rallying character may Check on
that instead of their own. Play it up as words of encouragement.

### Rattle

Taunting, threatening, trash-talking, and demoralizing an enemy. This
Action is only effective if the target can understand the onslaught of
indignity hurled at them. This is a Check of <span
class="smallcaps">Nature</span> vs. <span
class="smallcaps">Motive</span>, but a spiteful, authoritative, or
comedic <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span> can do just as well. The
target cannot stop thinking about the insult if successful. This makes
them very error prone, inflicting a penalty to their next Action.

**Check:** <span class="smallcaps">Nature</span> vs. <span
class="smallcaps">Motive</span>

{: .outcomes }
>- **Success:** Foe’s next Action faces -1 penalty.
>- **Edge:** *each Edge worsens penalty by one.*
>- **Failure:** Foe shrugs off the ineffectual intimidation.
>- **Twists:** *Strain, reveal secret, offend ally, draw more foes,
etc.*

Penalties from multiple rattlers do not stack. A target only feels the
most hurtful heckling that round.

### Sneak

Moving silently and hiding in shadows are great ways to evade foes and
get into places you aren’t supposed to be. This only allows you to
*remain* unnoticed by others. It is not possible if someone is looking
right at you, or you do not have anywhere to hide. This is a Check of
<span class="smallcaps">Poise</span> vs. <span
class="smallcaps">Motive</span>, or the highest <span
class="smallcaps">Motive</span> in a group. A Stealthy Focus can swap in
for <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span>, if higher.

**Check:** <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span> vs. <span
class="smallcaps">Motive</span>

{: .outcomes }

>- **Success:** Remain unnoticed by your foes.
>- **Edge:** Adds to Attack bonus during Surprise, or steal/plant that
many small items.
>- **Failure:** They notice you.
>- **Twists:** *Strain, leave telltale clues, end up in different area,
drop gear, etc.*

**Hiding** is a matter of finding Cover rather than a checked Action. If
their seekers move into a position where the Cover would fail, the hider
can try a Sneak Check to slip away. The better the hiding spot, the
better the bonus to avoid discovery.

**Surprise** attacks can trigger after a successful Sneak. The surprised
side goes a Round without an Action. Next Round things go back to normal
for the survivors.

### Use

This covers miscellaneous moves using a device, tool or item. For
example, pulling a sticky lever, starting an unfamiliar vehicle, picking
a lock, etc. This is usually unchecked. If it calls for one, use a
relevant <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span> vs. a fiat Difficulty. Let
a failure stand - move the story along instead of allowing retries.

**Check:** <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span> vs. Difficulty

{: .outcomes }

>- **Success:** Uses the item properly.
>- **Edge:** Quicker, better, with flair, etc.
>- **Failure:** The task is harder than it looks.
>- **Twists:** *takes another Round to finish, break tools, attract
unwanted attention.*

##  Montages

A Montage Scene is a transition between intense Action Scenes. While
they may mark the passage of a long period of time in the setting, they
should pass quickly at the table. The Guide typically allows each player
a Montage then moves along to the next Scene. This helps with pacing and
avoids sessions spent agonizing over minute details.

If your party is engaged in Montages of different durations, it is fair
for those with shorter tasks to get another Montage. Distractions,
emergencies, and procrastination prevent further industry.

<center><strong>MONTAGES</strong></center>

{: .lh-0}
|     Montage    |     Check                     |     Successful Outcome              |
|----------------|:-----------------------------:|-------------------------------------|
|     Craft      |     Focus vs.   Difficulty    |     Finish project.                 |

|     Recover    |     Focus vs. Difficulty      |     Stabilize or heal wounds.       |
|     Relax      |     None                      |     Restore Strained Attributes.    |
|     Study      |     Focus vs. Difficulty      |     Search for clues or answers.    |
|     Travel     |     Focus vs. Difficulty      |     Arrive safely.                  |

### Craft

If players want to try their hand at lengthy undertakings such as art,
smithing, repair, writing, lockpicking, etc., they must gather the right
materials and make a Check on a relevant <span
class="smallcaps">Focus</span>. Only call for Checks if there is time
pressure or real doubt about being able to finish.

**Check:** <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span> vs. Difficulty

{: .outcomes }

>- **Success:** a finished project.
>- **Edge:** *also finished that many other, less Difficult projects.*
>- **Failure:** unfinished project.
>- **Twists:** *Strain, waste materials, Strain Resources, weird flaw,
etc.*

Edge means while they were at it, they also got that many other things
done. These should relate to the same attempt and be less Difficult. For
example, a mechanic adding a nitro boost and a soup dispenser.

Wise characters may break a project into more manageable parts. A good
rule of thumb is to reduce the Difficulty by the number of crafters, up
to three. For example, an airplane mechanic has their assistant fix the
bent propeller while they work on the shot-up gas tank. They now face
two separate Checks, but each at two less Difficulty. The disadvantage
is that they may still fail one, leaving the project unfinished.

### Hustle

This Action spends time and effort to recover strained Credit or
relations with Contacts. This does not add new Contacts or boost
existing ones over your current Credit maximum. The Difficulty for this
is either the Travel Difficulty of the area (for Credit) or the <span
class="smallcaps">Motive</span> of the Contact. A business, trade, or
criminal <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span> is useful here, depending
on the nature of the deal.

**Check:** <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span> vs. local Travel
Difficulty or <span class="smallcaps">Motive</span> of Contact.

{: .outcomes }

>- **Success:** Regain one level of Resources or Contact.
>- **Edge:** *Emerge from the dealings with extra gifts or favors.*
>- **Failure:** Resources or Contacts remain strained.
>- **Twists:** *Strain, takes up another Montage, regaining Contact
strains Resources, regaining Resources strains Contact, etc.*

Extra gifts or favors from Edge should ideally be something that moves
the emergent story along, like important gear or clues.

### Recover

This is for life and death situations well beyond the ordinary stitching
of wounds. Recover Checks <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span> vs. local
Travel Difficulty or a Fallen patient’s negative Mettle, whichever is
greater. Success only stabilizes the patient. Spending all Edge clears
one Status: either Shaken, Broken, or Fallen. Failure inflicts a new
Shaken/Broken/Fallen Status. if the patient already has all three, they
die.

**Check:** <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span> vs. Travel Difficulty or
negative Mettle.

{: .outcomes }

>- **Success:** Patient stable for this Montage.
>- **Edge:** spend all Edge and clear one: Shaken, Broken, or Fallen.
>- **Failure:** inflict Shaken, Broken, Fallen, or Dead.
>- **Twists:** *Strain, takes another Montage to find out result, Strain
Resources, waste medicine or surgical tools.*

If a Shaken or Broken character opts out of a Recovery Montage, it
counts as a Recovery failure. A Fallen character may Recover on their
own by Checking <span class="smallcaps">Motive</span> vs. the local
Travel Difficulty.

Do not use Recover to cure an Affliction such as poison or disease.
Instead, use a Know Check on a medical <span
class="smallcaps">Focus</span> to reveal the antidote or cure, if such a
thing is available.<span id="_Ref109217679" class="anchor"></span>

### Relax

Adventure takes its toll on the body and spirit, so it is important to
kick back and unwind when the opportunity presents itself. Such
opportunities arise as events like a night out on the town, a shopping
trip, group meditation, a visit to the hot springs, a birthday party,
etc. Those who take part clear one Strain from each Attribute.

This gets even better if *anyone* in the group has a relevant
Background, such as when carousing in a city with one of its native
sons. In that case, each participant gets to clear one more Strain from
a single chosen Attribute. This only applies once even if other
Backgrounds could also enhance the outing.

There is no Roll or Check for this Montage, use it to explore the
lighter sides of your characters.

### Study

Hunt for clues or knowledge. Consider this Montage a more thorough and
time-consuming version of the Know Action. For example, an investigator
returning to the crime scene for more clues, an occult researcher
hitting the forbidden books section of the library, a clown visiting the
hall of eggshell faces to understand his rival, a gambler scouting out
the action at a local casino, etc. Study Checks a relevant <span
class="smallcaps">Focus</span> vs. a fiat Difficulty.

**Check:** <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span> vs. Difficulty

{: .outcomes }

>- **Success:** Guide answers two questions or grants two clues.
>- **Edge:** expendable bonus dice for related Checks.
>- **Failure:** Guide answers only one question or grants a clue.
>- **Twists:** *Strain, add misleading clue, unwanted attention, -1
fatigue penalty  from poor sleep.*

A misleading clue adds one to the number of clues or answers. It is up
to the Player to guess, but devious Guides may sow doubt effortlessly by
making all the info true.

Spend bonus dice from Edge on any upcoming related Check. These
disappear when used, as the limited knowledge is no longer fresh.

As with Know, frame these questions carefully to get the best info. This
can be an immensely useful Montage if the party is stuck on what to do
or missed clues earlier.

### Travel

Travel between areas often just serves as the narrative opening of a new
scene. This is perfectly fine. For example, “*After a bit of the usual
traffic on I-95 you find yourselves eating crabs at the Bulging
Bushel*.” If the journey is as important as the destination, use this
Montage to give it more weight. The players get to make decisions and
the Guide gets to add drama with encounters!

Travel is a Group Check of the best navigation or area knowledge <span
class="smallcaps">Focus</span>, with the Difficulty being how rough the
area between is. Success means they arrived safely, and failure a
dangerous or troublesome encounter along the way. You can also “zoom in”
further, requiring individual Travel Checks to get to interesting places
*between* the start and goal, as in a point-crawl map. In any case, this
is meant to enhance not restrict. Parties who really want to go
somewhere should be able to “drop a pin” and set an unplanned
destination.

A single Travel Check can stand for hours, days, or weeks depending on
the size of the map. Adventurers “travel on their stomachs.” Lacking
food or other needs inflicts a -1 penalty per day to the Travel Check as
they scrounge for supplies. This makes it important to prepare well.

**Check:** <span class="smallcaps">Focus</span> vs. Difficulty

{: .outcomes }

>- **Success:** arrive at destination safely.
>- **Edge:** *compare to beat rival parties or foes to destination.*
>- **Failure:** arrive at destination if you survive an encounter.
>- **Twists:** *Strain, get lost and move to adjacent area, ambushed
later at destination, lose supplies or trade goods.*

An ***Encounter*** is an event rolled or chosen by the Guide. These can
be dangerous, obnoxious, beneficial, or just interesting. Examples
include running across enemies, becoming fatigued, or finding a
mysterious statue. Even on a success, the Guide may want to Roll and
describe the area to give the players a feel for the setting. One trick
is to think up a dangerous Encounter but only describe the telltale
signs (tracks, noises, spoor, etc.) of what they would have faced.

Rivals or foes can Travel too, giving them their own Edge result. The
highest Edge arrives first, which can be important for staking claims or
laying ambushes. If that doesn’t apply, they may also meet a helpful
NPC, find a hidden area, stumble across an unusual artifact, etc.

## Scenery

Active foes and enemies are not the only danger faced by characters,
whether inside or outside of combat. This section holds all sorts of
hazardous features to spice up a Scene.

### Affliction

Virulent plagues, toxic court treachery, a sickly miasma, radioactive
death zones, or venomous creatures are ugly ways to die. These differ by
potence, method of exposure, interval between Rolls, and effect.

Exposure triggers a Roll of 1d6 + Potence, subtracting the victim’s
<span class="smallcaps">Frame</span> from the result. If the result is
positive, it becomes a penalty to all Checks. Write the Affliction
status and its current penalty on the character sheet (i.e., “Affliction
-2”). If the penalty exceeds the Motive of the character, they suffer
the Effect instead.

Afflictions are persistent. Every Interval afterward, the Affliction
loses one Potence and Rolls again. This ends when Potence drops to zero.
Potence restores upon re-exposure. For example, taking another sleep
dart or staying in a cave filled with poison gas.

Diseases or radiation subtract <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span> from
the Roll instead of <span class="smallcaps">Frame.</span> Roll for these
during the next Montage. It is rare for a victim to know exactly how
they were exposed, so treat it as a fun, gross mystery.

You can cure Afflictions with the right antidote, herb, or drug. This
drops Potence to zero, ending any penalty or Effect. If uncertain, an
Know Check based on medical knowledge can tell what works and if
treatment is even available.

### Cover

Combatants can use objects in the environment to protect themselves from
ranged attacks, referred to as taking ***Cover***. There are two types
of Cover: ***Partial*** and ***Total***. Partial Cover adds +2 to <span
class="smallcaps">Poise</span> when targeted and Total Cover prevents
targeting entirely for both the attacker and the defender. One may pop
out of Total Cover and target another character, but it then counts as
Partial until the start of their next Action.

“Taking cover” in combat only requires a Move into the area with the
desired Cover. Whether one has it depends on where the attacker and
target are in relation to each other. For example, a stone wall only
grants Cover against attackers on the other side. A chain link fence
might grant full Cover against throwing axes but only +1 against
gunshots, etc. Use your best judgment.

Shields are portable Cover, and as such do not stack with Cover.

{: .highlight }
>-   *Partial Cover:* +2 to <span class="smallcaps">Poise</span> vs.
    incoming Attacks
>-   *Total Cover*: no incoming or outgoing Attacks succeed. If you pop
    out to Attack, it becomes Partial Cover until your next Action.

### Deprivation

Amidst fantastic perils, it is still possible to suffer from the lack of
basic needs, such as thirst, hunger, fatigue, and suffocation. An
adventurer needs one serving of rations, a liter or so of water each
day, roughly six hours of rest, and ample air. Lacking these can have
real effects:

- **Hunger:** each week without food Strains base <span
class="smallcaps">Frame</span> by one. At 0, the character has starved
to death. Each day of normal rations restores 1 <span
class="smallcaps">Frame</span>. This *does not* stack with the similar
effects of Thirst.
- **Thirst:** each day without water Strains <span
class="smallcaps">Frame</span> by one. At 0, they die from dehydration.
Each day of normal drinking restores 1 <span
class="smallcaps">Frame</span>. This *does not* stack with the similar
effects of Hunger.
- **Fatigue:** each day without rest inflicts a -1 penalty to all Checks.
A full day of rest removes this effect. A fatigued character might fall
asleep as a Twist on a failed Check.
- **Suffocation:** a character can hold their breath for 1d6 + <span
class="smallcaps">Poise</span> Rounds (~6 seconds each) before
Incapacitation. They then get another set of rounds equal to <span
class="smallcaps">Poise</span> before dying. Resuscitation is a normal
Recover Check.

These are not very heroic ways to go and are mainly here to give a good
reason to buy rations, shelter, and water. This sort of “resource
management” is a whole sub-game some players really enjoy.

### Falls

Damage of course depends on how far the character fell. This is a Roll
of 1d6, adding +1 for every building story or ~5 meters, soaked by <span
class="smallcaps">Poise</span>. A short fall such as a trip or tumbling
into a trench does 1d6, a fall from a second story window or tree does
1d6+1, a fall from a tall tree or a few floors of a building usually
does 1d6+3, etc. The most one can take is 1d6+10, such as jumping off a
cliff. Survival from terminal velocity is thus *possible*, but extremely
*unlikely*.

The daring may ***Plummet*** onto an enemy below, adding one to their
Attack bonus for every plus on the falling Roll. They still suffer their
own falling damage as normal.

{: .highlight }
>-   **Falls:** 1d6 damage, +1 per 5 full meters or so, soaked with <span
    class="smallcaps">Poise</span>.
>-   **Plummet:** +1 to Attack bonus per 5 full meters fallen.

### Fire

Man's greatest elemental friend and enemy, fire is a common hazard in
games and fiction. This does damage each round until the target escapes
the source. Fire damage depends on how big the fire is and how hot it is
burning, subtracting <span class="smallcaps">Frame</span> as usual. For
example, a torch or campfire would do 1d6, a raging Bonfire 1d6+2 or so,
and a forge or lava flow 1d6+4.

Some targets are naturally flammable, such as wood, mummies,
tree-monsters, or rags. Others become flammable via napalm, gasoline, or
magical curses. Flammable targets take on the Burning Status, meaning
they cannot Rally and continue to take the same damage each Round until
extinguished or burnt to cinders.

{: .highlight }
>-   **Fire:** 1d6 for small, 1d6+2 for medium, 1d6+4 for large

### Traps

Traps are sinister surprises for daring adventurers; faceless, “ambient”
hazards without their own will. Every hidden trap has a ***Trigger***,
such as the Character walking down the hallway, turning a door handle,
etc. In that moment, it is also possible to detect and avoid it. If
successful, the Guide describes the trap and asks how they are escaping
it, such as leaping to the side of the pit or pulling away from a door
handle. A Character can still suffer if they make a bad choice!

Avoiding a trap is a Move Check upon triggering the device. Assume all
characters are looking out for traps as best as they can, with no need
to declare it. If a character declares they are the one to scout for
traps, graciously let them be the first target of any they run into.

An obvious “trap” such as an open pit or lava pool is more of an
obstacle the party may just *choose* to avoid. Some are still
irresistible to curious parties. This is also true of already-known
hidden traps.

- **Flooding room:** this small adjoining room has a strange idol in the
center. If players linger, the doors close and it begins to fill with
water, flooding entirely in 5 Rounds. If anyone kneels before the idol
the water drains away. *Difficulty 8, Drowning.*
- **Pitfall:** a carefully weighted trapdoor covers a shaft down to the
next floor. Triggered by the first one to walk onto it, anyone nearby
could also blunder in. *Difficulty 4, 1d6 Falling damage.*
- **Scything blade:** a pressure plate in the hallway triggers a massive
hidden blade to swing towards the victim. The victim hears a metallic
whirring at head height and has a split second to get horizontal and
avoid decapitation. *Difficulty 6, 2d6 damage.*
- **Tripwire:** stout twine between two trees around the bandit camp sets
off a crude tin-can alarm. *Difficulty 4, alerts the bandits.*

Parties may come up with other ways to escape or avoid traps, and you
should reward creative ideas instead of forcing them to play out the
trap as written.

### Visibility

Things like darkness, underbrush, and smoke make tasks related to vision
more difficult. In general, dim light is worth a -1 penalty and total
darkness a -3. Equipment such as torches or night vision goggles can
remove this penalty. Sudden flashes of bright light can also inflict a
visibility penalty for the opposite reason.

{: .highlight }
>-   Lighting or obscurement inflicts -1 to -3 to sight-related Checks.
